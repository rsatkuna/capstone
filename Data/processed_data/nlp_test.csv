Tal Piterbraut-Merx,29.0,2021-10-25,Ile-de-France,France,48.8588336,2.2769952,suicide,suicide,"Tal died by suicide. He was an activist, university student and author who was dedicated to progressive causes. On this day we mourn the loss of our comrade (and for some, our friend) Tal Piterbraut-Merx who passed away on Monday, October 25, 2021. A dedicated militant, a brilliant university student, prolific author and comrade, Tal identified himself as a gouine and was on all fronts or almost: anti-capitalist fights, fights against adult domination, feminist fights, emancipation fights queer, of course the anti-racist fights. Tal joined the Revolutionary Jews and Jews collective on shared findings: the violence of anti-Semitism and the absence of organization on the left to oppose it. The one of the deficiencies existing in our social camp in terms of analysis and fighting anti-Semitism. The one of the need to articulate fighting anti-Semitism and fight against all forms of oppression and exploitation. On the need also to positively reinvest justice, through the struggle, but also the rediscovering of Jewish cultural and historical heritage. Tal brought into the collective his energy, his involvement, his humanity. He participated in building public interventions of the collective. This is how he was found at the stand of the gathering in memory of Ilan Halimi in 2021. Tal was also very involved in the creation and animation of anti-Semitism trainings. As in his fights against child abuse, developing a pedagogy to train anti-racist fights was a fundamental form of action for him. He shared his knowledge, his political views, his ideas.  Many of us recognized ourselves in his, in her journey and in what she was relentlessly fighting against: violence against children, violence of patriarchy, anti-Semitism, racism, capitalism, which translates to everyday da Our lives and in the flesh. His suicide, like the too many before him, reminds us bitterly that this mortal social order must be shot down without a change. Because this is especially the incest of which our comrade died.  His thought, his action and his revolutionary commitment, but also his bright and malicious personality will remain in our memories for a long time. He was undoubtedly an example of what our political camp can give the best. Our organization and the entire Diaspora can be very proud to have a person like Tal in their ranks. We will honor him by continuing his fight to victory.

[Kimberly] and Mariela were killed by Mirco Alessi, a 42-year-old separated worker and father, who confessed to their murder: for some time the Kimberly and Alessi had a stable relationship but, according to the murderer, she made constant requests for money to him, threatening to make their relationship public. At this point Alessi decided to kill her: an admission that could turn the crime into premeditated murder. According to the killer's story, he arrived at [Kimbely's] house and immediately a furious argument broke out at the height of which Alessi grabbed a large kitchen knife and repeatedly stabbed her. At home there were also two of  [Kimberly's] Dominican friends, who shared the apartment with her: Alessi also attacked them.

Cielo de Lucca,21.0,2021-05-10,Buenos Aires,Argentina,-34.976762,-57.9999457,violence,shot,"Cielo was killed along with her cisgender neighbour Florencia Sandoval by Florencia's police officer boyfriend following an argument. He subsequently shot himself. In a case that occurred this afternoon in the town of Los Hornos in La Plata, a 23-year-old Buenos Aires Police officer murdered his partner, a young woman of the same age, in a femicide, along with a 22 [other sources say 20]-year-old trans woman and then shot himself in the head, leaving himself in critical condition. He died a few hours later.  The violent sequence began around 2:30 p.m. in 164 between 62 and 63 when a call to 911 indicated that detonations of firearms had been heard. Troops from the La Plata Patrol Command and Third Police Station went to the scene and immediately noticed the presence of the body of a young woman lying on the street and that of a trans woman in a corridor. An ambulance arrived at the scene and the doctors found that both people no longer showed vital signs. Neighbors gave clues about the attacker, who had fled the scene in a white Volkswagen Gol car. In an operation, the police located the suspect and there was a chase up to 166 between 59 and 60. In that direction the alleged aggressor got out of the car, showed a firearm to the police and went into a residence. Minutes later a detonation was heard and upon entering the uniformed men they found the young man with a shot to the head, after which he was rushed to the San Martín Hospital.  Initial investigations confirmed that the shooting was a femicide and that the young trans woman was shot when she went to see what happened. The policeman was identified as Juan Ignacio Soto, who served in the UTOI, Florencia Sandoval (23) and Cielo de Lucca (22).Soto was reportedly violent and [Cielo had defended Florencia from him  The day of her violent death was not the first time that Cielo defended her neighbor. The two had made very good friends during the four months in which they shared land, by dividing, in 164 between 62 and 63.  The young trans woman moved to one of the three apartments that are rented on the property with her sister, but she left shortly after and the costs of the rent were left for a single person. José María (58), owner of the place, said that the deceased's idea was to leave. That's where she was when she was killed.  Agostina asserted that “that violent son of a bitch (by Juan Ignacio Soto) attacked her more than once and Cielo defended her. She told me that he would not leave them alone and from then on the chabón took hold of him and was suspicious”. To such an extent that the last time the sex workers saw each other ""was on the street, a month ago, and it was there that she told me what was happening and showed that she was all hurt,"" he remarked.  “She died doing what she loved, defending and helping those in need.

In the early hours of January 24, in the city of Paraná (Entre Ríos), the death of Jésica Benavídez, a 33-year-old trans woman who survived as a sex worker and lived in extreme poverty, was confirmed. Her companions called her ""La Nicky"". She was originally from Santa Elena (La Paz) and had arrived in the capital of Entre Ríos more than 10 years ago.  The body was delivered to her family this Friday, January 25, at dawn and moved to Santa Elena. Her remains were veiled in the Cocheria Sabatini, located on 636 Paraná street, in her hometown, and buried in the early hours of this afternoon.  Today also some results of the autopsy were known: it showed that there were no signs of violence in the death of Jésica Benavídez. Now the results of the toxicological analyzes are awaited. It was a neighbor who saw the lifeless body of Jessica inside her ranch. She was semi-naked and sitting, lifeless, in a chair.  ""We are in shock. She was an extraordinary person. Some compañeras saw her last night on the street and they say that she went home with a boy, ""Iara Quiroga, a trans activist from Paraná told Presentes.  ""I can not get over my shock.

The speakers said that Bijlee was a kind transgender woman who was known to be on good terms with her neighbours. Her primary source of income was begging. This week, she was strangled to death in her own house.  Toffe, was a young 19-year old transgender woman who was refused treatment at the Dr Ruth KM Pfau Civil Hospital because she was HIV-positive. She subsequently died because of denial of her basic right.

Her death does not seem to have been reported by the media. My transgender niece Jessica passed on July-18-21. she was a member of the LGBTQ+ community. She was so happy when she transitioned and was able to take female hormones. She suffered from schizophrenia and never finished the transition. She was found in a laundry mat and reported as an overdose but the coroner hasn't reported yet. She had been the victim of multiple hate attacks.  I want to thank all that have shared, contributed on here and in person. Those that have shared with us some very heartwarming stories of Jessica helping others. I always knew she had a huge heart and she'd help any way she could even though she had very little. Please continue sharing those stories and the fundraiser. Were almost at the amount to bring her home.  We are fundraising to cover the cost of her cremation and a celebration of life.Jessica volunteered often at a local LGBT centre. They said this about her: Jessica was vibrant and full of life. She was loved by many in our community. Jessica volunteered frequently at the local LGBT center and would be at any and every event, protest, and march the center organized. She was fantastic at engaging with the community, and cared deeply for those around her.

Bru Waldorf,28.0,2021-07-29,Rio de Janeiro,Brazil,-22.911014,-43.209373,medical,COVID-19,"Bru died from COVID-19. She lived with an evangelical birth family who did not respect her identity and had done whatever they could to obstruct her transition.As Orgulho Transgênero said in a Facebook post (which is reproduced in full below) ""*She didn't just die of covid, she died from having to live trapped in an extremely hostile environment, cruel to extremely damaging transphobia, with no support to have a professional career without support of any nature without support becoming independent of the business of that transphobic family.*""  TRANSPHOBIA KILLS!  Bru Waldorf was from an evangelical and transphobic middle class family, who didn't respect the fact that she was a trans woman, they never supported her and even at the time of her death the parent doesn't respect her, with revolting Facebook post as if she didn't it was the female type.  She had already posted how oppressed she was by a family that never supported who she was, a total cowardice with her dignity. She couldn't even try to change her name and gender on her birth certificate and documents because her parents wouldn't accept it.  She already posted showing desperation for finding a job that respected her social name, because it was a very oppressive family. They've already thrown it in her face that she was sustained but if they had supported the fact that they had a trans daughter and supported her in a professional career she could have a job and be independent.  Apparently the place of his residence also operated an inn, business of the evangelical pastor progenitor, businessman and a cowardly and transphobic inhuman. With family business, it was a very dangerous environment for contamination.  She didn't just die of covid, she died from having to live trapped in an extremely hostile environment, cruel to extremely damaging transphobia, with no support to have a professional career without support of any nature without support becoming independent of the business of that transphobic family. They killed her. Lately she couldn't even go out once a month like before because of the pandemic and living in an environment like this, had a very big psychological impact on her. But the transphobic business let the pandemic indoors.  The genocidal Jair who is also a disgusting transphobic and scoundrel should also be held responsible for not buying the vaccines as soon as he could.  The fundamentalist religion so called Christian, the religion of parents is also to blame for this because it has always fostered transphobia, criminal LGBTphobia and are one of those responsible for putting criminal genocidal in the presidency.  Transphobia kills, transphobia burns people alive, leads people to depression, suicide, excludes from society, kicked out of the house. And when you don't kick out like Bru's case, you keep trans people being tortured in a terrible environment like what she lived through.  I have no empathy with transphobic killers. These murderers transphobic scoundrels of her parents would die, but that she was alive and well. But most times bad vase doesn't break.  Unlike these transphobic scoundrels, Bru, or Bruna, as she wanted, for me and for many friends and friends will be remembered as she really is, an amazing, amazing woman. I've cried a lot and the crying will be until when I die. You will forever be loved my dear friend.Bru's ",2021.0,Rio de Janeiro,0,"['bru', 'died', 'from', 'covid', '19', 'she', 'lived', 'with', 'an', 'evangelical', 'birth', 'family', 'who', 'did', 'not',

Sana Khan,16.0,2019-08-30,Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,Pakistan,34.06282,72.09875,violence,stabbed,"Sana was killed by her brother. She was a Pashto musician and her murder follows that of several others in the province. SWAT: Yet another Pashto artist was killed allegedly by her brother in Swat on Friday. TNN correspondent has reported that the singer, Sana, was stabbed to death in Banr area, a famous center for Pashto musicians in Swat district. Police said that so far the motive behind the brutal murder couldn’t be ascertained as they are still conducting the investigation into the case. Police added that the accused is the real brother of the victim, who escaped after committing the crime. The dead body of the artist, Sana, was shifted to Saidu Sharif Hospital for post mortem. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has never been a safe place for Pashto artists as a number of women singers have been killed by their relatives. On May 7, 2019, local singer Meena was killed in Swat. According to police, Meena, was killed by her husband in Banr area of Swat. In recent years, Pashto music has lost famous singer Ghazala Javed at the hands of her husband. Ayman Udas, another artiste, was allegedly killed by her brothers over claims of dishonouring the family. Singer Rabia Tabasum was poisoned. The 18-year-old Pashto singer Karishma Shahzadi was allegedly killed after being injected with a spurious injection in Charsadda.

Edu,18.0,2019-10-30,Valencia,Spain,39.625829,-0.59611,suicide,suicide,"Edu took her own life, apparently after suffering harassment and bullying over an extended period. The Civil Guard and the Court of Instruction No. 3 of Llíria are investigating whether harassment and teasing have been the trigger for a young transsexual from Llíria to take her own life last Wednesday afternoon. The agents of the Judicial Police team of the capital of the Camp de Túria have already begun the procedures to cite friends, fellow students and relatives as witnesses, to investigate to what extent [transphobia] in her immediate surroundings could have been a trigger in her decision to take her own life. The young woman, who had been in treatment for some time and had already taken the first steps to face the change of sex after turning 18, took her own life on Tuesday, after being alone at the home of a friend in Llíria with whom she was spending the afternoon. Hours after her death, many people expressed their solidarity with the girl and her family in social networks - mainly WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram - and criticized the mockery that the young woman had been subjected to. In fact, Levante-EMV has been able to verify the succession of insults, teasing and criticism that the young woman had been enduring for months every time she posted videos and photographs on one of her social network accounts doing what she liked most: playing songs of her favorite artists. The young woman was a great follower of the talent show La Voz. Once these suspicions of harassment have been confirmed, the judge and the Civil Guard will seek testimonies, especially from close friends, to be able to confirm if that pressure acted as a trigger to convince her to end her life, something she did while her friend was absent for a few minutes. It will also be investigated if it is true that she suffered aggressions from relatives in her home environment, and if so whether they were prompted by her decision to [live as herself]. The Civil Guard will also track comments on the social networks of the young woman, mainly on Facebook and Instagram, in which she received insults and mockery regarding her transsexuality. Some of those comments date back more than a year, which shows that he had been suffering from this situation for a long time.If the agents manage to prove the relationship between harassment and death, the case could end up being instructed as a hate crime.",2019.0,Lliria,0,"['edu', 'took', 'her', 'own', 'life', 'apparently', 'after', 'suffering', 'harassment', 'and', 'bullying', 'over',

Yesterday friends and family buried the remains of Anahy Rivas, a transsexual woman who was killed early Saturday morning and her body abandoned in front of a nightclub [named Kairos] on Bulevar Los Héroes in San Salvador. One of Anahy's friends reported yesterday during the funeral that men in a van arrived alongside where the victim was (by the Benjamin Bloom hospital) and the occupants grabbed her by force and drove off. ""The men did not manage to get her fully into the vehicle when it began to move so that her legs dragged along the ground.

When she appeared to be dead, her kidnappers threw her on the pavement.In December 2019 Juan Carlos Hernández Vásquez, 40, was arrested for her murder and released on bail. In January 2020 a second arrest warrant was issued. A video surveillance system allowed investigators to locate the vehicle of the accused. With the information that the system offered the authorities and the tracking of his cell phone, the authorities followed up the suspect until he was arrested early Wednesday when he was just leaving his home, in the El Carmen canton, in the Escalón neighborhood, to the west of San Salvador.

Cris Blehar,65.0,2021-05-21,Kentucky,United States of America,37.83903972,-86.06595063,violence,stabbed and shot,"Cris was killed in her home. A suspect has been charged and is due to be tried in June 2022. The family of a U.S. Air Force veteran who was murdered in May has identified her as transgender, making her the at least 49th transgender person to be killed violently in the United States this year, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC)   65-year-old Cris Blehar was found stabbed and shot to death in her Kentucky home. An 18-year-old suspect, Tyler J. Petty, who police say may have worked for Blehar, has reportedly confessed to the murder and will go to trial in June 2022.  Blehar’s obituary describes her as an animal lover who formerly worked for Continental Airlines and then as an Uber Driver. She left behind a son, [name redacted].  Blehar’s cousin, Mark Stephens, contacted HRC to identify her as trans. Stephens wanted Blehar to be “remembered, honored, and counted.”Cris was a former law enforcement officer in the U.S. Air Force and retired from United/Continental Airlines. She also worked as an Uber driver and loved animals and bowling. “If there is one thing to know about Cris, it was that she fought fiercely to define her life as SHE wanted. Whether it was her military service, her 20+ year career in the airline industry, or her post retirement decision to buy a farm & start a family of her own. She lived life to the fullest and wanted everyone around her to live their best life as well. Growing up ‘different’ in Kentucky is certainly no easy task, something we shared in addition to being cousins, and she tackled it with the passion and zeal that only she could have. Her friends will always remember her infectious personality & her unmistakable laugh. She loved others passionately and fiercely, none more than her own son, [name redacted].”  Blehar’s son [name redacted] also remembered her, writing:  “Cris was an amazing mother and a wonderful person. She had so much love and brought a smile to many. She had a hilarious sense of humor that will live on through those that knew her. She will be sorely missed!”  Cris was full of life and it is appalling that she was so violently taken from this Earth. It is comforting to know that she was well loved by friends and family, but her death highlights the need to combat gun violence and all of the factors that contribute to these killings.” As Cris' murder only came to light after the Transgender Day of Remembrance 2021 her name was not included in the official TDoR 2021 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU) in November 2021.Her

Maddie Hoffman,47.0,2022-05-19,Pennsylvania,United States of America,40.0339299,-75.5316909,violence,shot,"Maddie died after being shot by police during a wellbeing check at her home. Maddie Hofmann – a 47-year-old trans woman and parent of two young children – was shot and killed by police on 19 May during a wellness check at their home in Malvern, Pennsylvania.   The Chester County District Attorney’s Office claimed the police shooting was “justified” and isn’t indicting the officers who shot Hoffman three times, leading to their death. The police report detailed a struggle over a firearm as the ‘justification’ for the shooting.   Police found Hoffman in their home experiencing a mental health crisis and yelling that they were in a “crisis situation”. Investigators said the struggle and shooting happened in less than a minute, Fox 29 reported.   Hoffman was born in Korea and raised by their adopted family in New Jersey and Vermont, according to a GoFundMe created in honour of the late trans woman.  “Maddie’s family is devastated by this loss. Nationwide, police are usually the first responders to people with mental health crises,” the campaign said.  It continued: “They are often not trained to provide proper support and the results have been deadly and devastating. “Maddie’s family wishes to elevate this important issue so that it does not happen to another person ever again.”Maddie is survived by her wife and two young children. Her wife recorded a video on TikTok describing how their  9-year-old son saw the police as his heroes until they killed Maddie:Just a few weeks later another trans person - [Jasper Aaron  - was killed in a similar deadly encounter with police.

After the fatal shooting — one in a string of robberies targeting trans and cross-dressing sex workers — Riviera Beach police spokeswoman Rose Anne Brown said, “This suspect has targeted young men who are living a life as transsexual prostitutes.”  Whether Jackson was trans is not clear, though his sister Takesia Jackson told local reporters that her brother was gay.  De Los Santos was pulled over for a routine traffic stop last Thursday, and police noticed he was driving the same type of vehicle the killer had been driving: a 2003 silver Buick Rendezvous.  ""When someone has put it in their mind to perhaps target individuals because of the way that they live their lifestyle, not only is that interfering with their safety, that's interfering with their personal freedoms,"" Riviera Beach police spokeswoman Rose Anne Brown told WPBF. Luis Rijo de los Santos took a plea deal requiring him to spend the next 15 years in prison for her killing and that of two others the same night.

Leo Etherington,15.0,2017-05-31,England,United Kingdom (Great Britain),51.627422,-0.748415,suicide,suicide,"Leo died by suicide. His school had refused to use his new name even though he had transitioned the year before. Leo Etherington had come out at home and at school – but teachers at Wycombe high school, an all-girls grammar school, told the 15-year-old that he could not change his name on the register for another year.  Giving evidence at an inquest into his son’s death, Martin Etherington said: “The school told him he had to be 16 to change his name. He said he was angry with the school.  “I asked him if I should speak to them and he said no. I said we could wait until he was 16 and then change his name.”  The student had also been told by the family GP that he would not be eligible for gender reassignment surgery on the NHS. In his evidence his father said: “I told Leo I would fund any surgery when the time came.”  The family thought Leo was studying for forthcoming GCSE exams in his room on the afternoon of his death on 31 May. But his father found his body in his room after he missed calls to come down to dinner. Mr Etherington added: “The school told him he had to be 16 to change his name. He said The tragedy is that both the school and his GP were incorrect - there was no reason the school could not have respected his identity, and the NHS can fund testosterone therapy for trans men from age 16 onwards, and surgery from 18.Leo's death was not included on the official TGEU TDoR 2017 list.",2017.0,High Wycombe,0,"['leo', 'died', 'by', 'suicide', 'his', 'school', 'had', 'refused', 'to', 'use', 'his', 'new', 'name', 'even', 'though', 'he', 'had', 'transitioned', 'the', 'year', 'before', 'leo', 'etherington', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'at', 'home', 'and', 'at', 'school', 'but', 'teachers', 'at', 'wycombe', 'high', 'school', 'an', 'all', 'girls', 'grammar', 'school', 'told', 'the', '15', 'year', 'old', 'that', 'he', 'could', 'not', 'change', 'his', 'name', 'on', 'the', 'register', 'for', 'another', 'year', 'giving', 'evidence', 'at', 'an', 'inquest', 'into', 'his', 'son', 's', 'death', 'martin', 'etherington', 'said', 'the', 'school', 'told', 'him', 'he', 'had', 'to', 'be', '16', 'to', 'change', 'his', 'name', 'he', 'said', 'he', 'was', 'angry', 'with', 'the', 'school', 'i', 'asked', 'him', 'if', 'i', 'should', 'speak', 'to', 'them', 'and', 'he', 'said', 'no', 'i', 'said', 'we', 'could', 'wait', 'until', 'he', 'was', '16', 'and', 'then', 'change', 'his', 'name', 'the', 'student', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'told', 'by', 'the', 'family', 'gp', 'that', 'he', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'eligible', 'for', 'gender', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'on', 'the', 'nhs', 'in', 'his', 'evidence', 'his', 'father', 'said', 'i', 'told', 'leo', 'i', 'would', 'fund', 'any', 'surgery', 'when', 'the', 'time', 'came', 'the', 'family', 'thought', 'leo', 'was', 'studying', 'for', 'forthcoming', 'gcse', 'exams', 'in', 'his', 'room', 'on', 'the', 'afternoon', 'of', 'his', 'death', 'on', '31', 'may', 'but', 'his', 'father', 'found', 'his', 'body', 'in', 'his', 'room', 'after', 'he', 'missed', 'calls', 'to', 'come', 'down', 'to', 'dinner', 'mr', 'etherington', 'added', 'the', 'school', 'told', 'him', 'he', 'had', 'to', 'be', '16', 'to', 'change', 'his', 'name', 'he', 'said', 'the', 'tragedy', 'is', 'that', 'both', 'the', 'school', 'and', 'his', 'gp', 'were', 'incorrect', 'there', 'was', 'no', 'reason', 'the', 'school', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'respected', 'his', 'identity', 'and', 'the', 'nhs', 'can', 'fund', 'testosterone', 'therapy', 'for', 'trans', 'men', 'from', 'age', '16', 'onwards', 'and', 'surgery', 'from', '18', ""leo's"", 'death', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'on', 'the', 'official', 'tgeu', 'tdor', '2017', 'list']",leo died by suicide his school had refused to use his new name even though he had transitioned the year before leo etherington had come out at home and at school but teacher at wycombe high school an all girl grammar school told the 15 year old that he could not change his name on the register for another year giving evidence at an inquest into his son s death martin etherington said the school told him he had to be 16 to change his name he said he wa angry with the school i asked him if i should speak to them and he said no i said we could wait until he wa 16 and then change his name the student had also been told by the family gp that he would not be eligible for gender reassignment surgery on the nh in his evidence his father said i told leo i would fund any surgery when the time came the family thought leo wa studying for forthcoming gcse exam in his room on the afternoon of his death on 31 may but his father found his body in his room after he missed call to come down to dinner mr etherington added the school told him he had to be 16 to change his name he said the tragedy is that both the school and his gp were incorrect there wa no reason the school could not have respected his identity and the nh can fund testosterone therapy for trans men from age 16 onwards and surgery from 18 leo's death wa not included on the official tgeu tdor 2017 list

Lorena María del Luján Riquel,39.0,2020-08-22,Santa Fe,Argentina,-32.9624275,-60.6998469,violence,beaten,"Lorena was beaten over the head with cement blocks. Police are investigating whether the perpetrator of the crime sexually abused her before killing her.  Her name was Lorena María del Luján Riquel, she was 39 years old, she was a breadwinner: she had three children. She made a living as she could, it was a struggle. Those who knew her said she had a stand at a fair located in the property known as “la quinta Luciani” in the western area, sold stockings on the street and was a sex worker.  From the beginning she was part of the Bella Vista Classist and Combative Current (CCC) and marched with this group in every  event of the social organization. She was a fighter.  At dawn this Saturday she was savagely murdered at Rueda 5500. The attacker attacked her, took off some of her clothes and hit her on the head until she was killed. Then he walked off in the victim's slippers.  The femicide of Lorena Riquel was reminiscent of that of Caren Peralta, murdered in a downtown apartment with a blow to the head last February. They were both sex workers. Gabriela, from the Ammar union, said that they are struck by the fact that it is the second femicide by the same method: killed by blows to the head.  The union of sex workers is accompanying the family and in contact with the Prosecutor's Office. Some of its members decided to go to the scene to find out what happened and the details of the case are really macabre. “They expose the contempt for the life of a woman, who is harassed and fiercely attacked by a man. A clear sample of the worst face of patriarchy”, they described.A suspect was arrested on 25th August. A 32-year-old man was arrested at dawn this Tuesday (25) for being suspected of being the alleged perpetrator of the brutal femicide of Lorena María del Luján Riquel, which occurred last Saturday in Rueda at 5500. He was apprehended in an operation carried out by the Brigade of Homicides of the Criminal Investigation Agency (AIC) in Rio de Janeiro at 2800.  The detainee, identified as Carlos Daniel B., was found by the security force in front of his home in Rio de Janeiro at 2800. He has a peculiarity: he has a tear tattooed on his left cheekbone. He was transferred to the headquarters of the Criminal Investigation Agency, where he was held incommunicado by order of the criminal homicide prosecutor Georgina

Veronica Baxter,34.0,2009-03-16,New South Wales,Australia,-33.8308128,151.0532673,custodial,died in custody,"After being arrested for drug offences Veronica was incarcerated in a male prison in Sydney despite having transitioned 15 years earlier. On 16th March, she was found hanging in her cell. Veronica, an aboriginal from Cunnamulla county, in the south-west of Queensland, had been living as a woman since 1994 when she was 19.  In March 2009, three days after the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, she was arrested in a police sting in Redfern, Sydney, and charged with supplying a prohibited drug, and held at the NSW Silverwater Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre, a maximum security jail for men. She was not offered the opportunity of solitary confinement in a women's jail instead, that by law should be offered to non-op trans women. She was in the general male population of the prison. She had not been checked for 14 hours – a contravention of policy – when she was found hanging in her cell from a 1.5m (5 foot) bunk despite being 1.98m (6'5'') tall. Veronica Baxter, a MTF transgender inmate who was housed in a male prison in Sydney, hanged herself in her cell back in March 2009. But lest you think the Department of Corrective Services is somehow at fault for having a female prisoner in a male facility, the coroner has decided to clear prison officials of any wrongdoing.  Deputy State Coroner Paul MacMahon said there was nothing to suggest any failure by the department contributed to the death of Veronica Baxter, who was found dead in her cell while on remand at Sydney’s Silverwater Correctional Centre in March 2009. Ms Baxter, formerly known as [deadname], underwent three separate assessments after her arrest on serious drug offences. On each occasion, she was asked about suicidal tendencies but she denied having any such thoughts. One counsellor described her as “smiling, happy and talking”, the coroner said on Monday at the NSW Coroner’s Court at Glebe.  She was held in the cells at the Sydney Police Centre in Surry Hills for five days before being transferred to the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, a male facility at Silverwater. Two days later, the 34-year-old pre-operative transgender male-to-female prisoner used a bed sheet to hang herself from a top bunk bed in her cell while awaiting classification.  During a previous incarceration, Baxter actually put in a request to be transferred to a female facility in 2001 before withdrawing it.  But the coroner’s conclusion isn’t likely to sit well with Baxter’s loved ones. From a report last year:  On March 10, 2009, three days after Mardi Gras, Veronica Baxter was arrested by Redfern police and held on remand at the all-male NSW Silverwater Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre. Six days later, after a 14-hour break between checking her cell, she was found dead, hanging in her single cell. Veronica Baxter was an Aboriginal woman from the Cunnamulla country, south-west of Queensland. She dressed, appeared, and had identified as a woman for 15 years and was known by family and friends as a woman. Yet she was placed in an all-male jail. Was Veronica Baxter killed in custody by transphobic guards or inmates? No-one knows, the only way we will find out is if there is a full, open inquiry.  And no wonder: Baxter, despite what prison officials claim, was not the happy-go-lucky inmate officials are making her out to be:  Ten inmates who were interviewed by a police investigator about Baxter’s mental state indicated that she “appeared to be angry about something [but] there were no indications that suggested that she intended to kill herself”. Baxter had made a number of calls to prison staff using the emergency ‘knock-up box’ in her cell while locked into her cell but no one at the prison could remember who had answered them or what she had wanted.  But don’t worry: Now that she’s dead, prison officials are totally gonna fix their mistakes.Veronica's death was not recorded on the official TDoR list released by Transgender Europe

Her friends and family came together in a vigil for her on Christmas Day. BALTIMORE — Close to two dozen people gathered at The Ynot Lot in Station North Friday to honor the life of Myliah Monae Mullin, a trans woman who lost her life Sunday.  ""I want people to get closer to your family,"" said Myliah's mother, Renita. ""Tomorrow’s not promised. Reach out to your family. Reach out to everyone because you never know what may happen to them.""  Family members believe Myliah took her own life, possibly due to depression. It's an issue made more difficult, compounded by the pandemic. Myliah's sisters shared their thoughts on resources within the community.  ""We all matter and we aren’t being heard enough,"" said London Justice. ""It’s really getting to me that all of our trans sisters are down here dying in the streets.""  ""It’s sickening to me, it hurts,"" said Tamar Jones. Jones works with Baltimore Safe Haven, a non-profit that seeks to provide opportunities for a higher quality of life for LGBTQ members in Baltimore City who are living in survival mode.  ""It hurts that a sister of mine is gone,"" said Jones. ""It hurts that the pandemic has so much going on with us. Because of the pandemic we can’t console each other like we want to. We have to keep our 6 feet, wear a mask. We can’t go spend time with our love ones [because] of COVID and that’s a problem.""

Nicol Ruiz,35.0,2022-09-26,Buenos Aires,Argentina,-34.953268,-57.9801207,violence,beaten,"Nicol died in hospital 3 days after being beaten by her brother in law when she intervened to defend her sister from him.Daniel Silvestrilli, 30, has been charged with her murder. Buenos Aires, Argentina. The travesti and trans community of La Plata is shocked by the transvesticide of Nicol Ruiz, a 35-year-old woman and mother of two children, who was savagely beaten on the head by her sister's partner.   The attack that led to her death was perpetrated on the night of Friday, September 23, at her sister's house. When Nicol arrived at the house, located between calles 141 and 79 in the Los Hornos neighborhood of La Plata, she found her sister arguing strongly with her partner, Daniel Silvestrilli.  Nicol intervened to stop the man's violence, but the aggressor reacted against her,  hitting her hard with a broomstick on the head until Nicol collapsed unconscious. Although she was immediately transferred to the San Martín hospital, she was hospitalized in serious condition and died on Monday the 26th.  Daniel Silvestrilli was detained in Prison Unit Number 36 of the Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service. According to the information provided by the Prosecutor's Office No. 2 of La Plata to Present, that Friday the man was not complying with his temporary exit regime and an arrest warrant was released for him. Silvestrilli was already serving a sentence of 9 years and six months in prison for aggravated robbery. For the woman's death, the accused must face charges of ""homicide in the context of gender violence."" Nicol was a parent who leaves behind two teenagers, and often cared for others in her community. Nicol was 35 years old and the mother of two teenagers. Her family emphasizes that she was the one who ran the house and was in charge of finances. During the pandemic, when the housing situation was extreme for the LGBT population , Nicol was supportive and took care of housing and asking for help for her colleagues who had nowhere to live.  The Otrans Civil Association, with whom she collaborated, remembered Nicol and demanded justice for his crime. “We express to her family and friends our deepest condolences and deep pain for the [murder] of our partner Nicol Ruiz. Likewise, we demand justice, taking into account the aggravating circumstance of hatred of self-perceived gender identity,"" the statement said.   “Nicol was a breadwinner, the mother of two children, who after her death are left without his protection. It becomes essential, to be part of the emotional agenda of our country and for society to mourn and be horrified when they kill a fellow [trans person]”.   Nicol Ruiz suffered from kidney failure and had to undergo dialysis treatment. For this reason, they estimate, the blow caused the immediate formation of a clot in her head that complicated the situation. Nicol's family and her friends called for a demonstration to be held on Wednesday, September 28 at 11 am in front of Prosecutor's Office 7 (at calles 56 and 57, La Plata) with the slogan ""enough

Patsy Andrea Delgado,28.0,2020-03-05,Chihuahua,Mexico,28.6308877,-106.0520237,violence,beaten,"Patsy's body was found in her home with a sack of cement on her head and a bloodied hammer next to her body. Chihuahua.- A transgender woman was found lifeless inside her home located in the Lealtad 2 neighborhood in Chihuahua. The authorities unofficially identified the victim with the name of Patsy Andrea Delgado. The events occurred at the intersection of calles 27 and Zubiran where she was found with a sack of cement on her head and a bloody hammer next to her body. Family members reported that they went to look for the victim and after getting no response after knocking on the door several times, they looked into a window and saw her lifeless body.Patsy was a stylist and an activist with [Pro Trans  Kendra Mitchell Vázquez, president of Pro Trans Chihuahua and a close friend of Patsy since her tender teenage days, remembers her cheerful and enterprising. Patsy loved life, used to face the daily pace of days with optimism and hard work, despite the precarious situations in which she could find himself. However, she ended up being a victim of violence and a world that pushes trans women to the narrowest corner of the room. Patsy had many gifts, such as being a stylist. Her job was her life, to which she printed all the passion that burned in her chest. Always innovating and studying to be the best, to leave a mark and legacy of what I could do, of what it was. As a warrior, she was a special guest at the Pro Trans Chihuahua association, where she gave a huge piece of her heart trying to watch over and protect her companions, her family. Her home, like her body, was part of the most valuable thing she had. Never satisfied, she kept building her house, block by block, detail by detail. She was always seen with construction material and in her conversations the great plans that she had for her home surfaced, of which she was increasingly proud. She was very responsible, methodical, inclined to look after her personal image, a lover of good things, beauty products, a joker, vivacious, happy, but a victim of an intolerant and violent society, especially of a Government that does not protect trans women, being murdered on Thursday, March 5, in that palace that she raised especially for a queen like her. Tears and pain now invade our community, dismayed by a situation that could have been avoided if the correct protection protocols existed for them. But, on the contrary, they live in a reality where they are nothing more than a vulnerable and fragile group, prey to hate crimes not only for those who raise their fists against them, but also of indolent society and a mocking and inhuman press. Between the crying, Mitchell, on behalf of all, demands justice and promises that it is a crime that will not go unpunished, because the voice will rise and they will go against the cruel leaders and the minds that think them. No more impunity, no more deaths of trans women, no more fear or vulnerability; We need justice, protection and respect.

According to Tampa police Tolliver, 23, was one of three suspects who arrived in a dark colored Dodge Magnum at 3911 East Genessee St where Lee was staying to care for a sick friend.  Consummate performer: 'I'm a comedian. Don't sit in the front row if you don't want to be picked on. I'm different. There's nobody on the Beach like me,' Anthony Lee told the Miami New Times in '98  The Miami New Times said Lee was cooking dinner at his friend's house the night of May 28 when a suspect knocked at the door.   Lee opened the door and was shot five times at point blank range. Police believe it may have been a case of mistaken identity.  According to Bay News 9, police think the house was targeted, but it is unclear if the bullet was meant for someone else, or if the case was a botched home invasion.Ms Wanda was a fixture on the Florida drag scene and also went by the names Anthony Lee and South Beach Wanda.Deandre Tolliver, 23, was arrested for first-degree murder and armed robbery in Lakeside the same day she was put to rest. His two accomplices are still at large. Wanda performed her swansong at Hamburger Mary's the Thursday before last.  King [her friend] said Wanda's career was long and successful, with gigs up and down the country. She first worked for King in 1991, and the two formed a close friendship over the years.  Wanda was known for her Whitney Houston obsession, snarky one-liners and outrageous antics including donning a dress made of tampons and jumping into a pool.  'She was very funny, hanging from the rafters and swinging, having fun. She impersonated Whitney Houston, wore balloons instead of a bra. When she was in the show, it was a show of her own,' said King.  At Thursday's fundraiser, a dozen fellow drag queens performed. Each began their performance with their fondest memory of Wanda, which was often of a memorable insult Wanda had thrown their way.  'We just want justice to be done,' said Power Infiniti, a fellow drag queen whose first meeting with Lee involved being laughed at.

Nobody ever took her out. She was removed from her work because she was trans. Her friends in the cities she went to hurt her, but she was not strong enough to fight. “A lot of people are responsible for this suicide. Many of my trans friends committed suicide, but Elif was very special to me.”Elif worked as a cleaner in a factory during the early months of 2016. At the time she told Pembe Hayat that she still missed her family and was ill treated by the factory manager and employees during her time at work. “When I started my transition, they knew my situation because I was in the same workplace. There is a lot of sexism in the factories. Women and men are not given the same jobs. But they treat me like they do to their business. They do not approve that their ablutions will be ruined, but they always have a job done by the guys in the factory and they call me a man and make me do it.” . They are trying to screw me up. The women working in the factory are doing the same thing. They know my situation. This is breaking my morale. Working conditions at work are already very heavy.

Helen Brigette Maldonado Maldonado,28.0,2021-11-12,Guayas,Ecuador,-2.0523001,-79.9459419,custodial,murdered,"Helen was one of 68 inmates killed during a riot in Penitenciaría del Litoral de Ecuador on the night of Friday 12th November.The country's prison system has been under a state of emergency since 29th September after the worst prison massacre recorded in the country, which took place in the same prison. [A list of those killed in the riot given to their  shows Helen as the 34th victim. She was 20 years old when she decided to give in to her transformation. Her preference for the feminine and her delicate treatment cost her pain, rejection, loneliness ... Nothing prevented her skin from giving space to the name she chose: Helen.  Each letter was engraved on her arm along with ink-stained stars. That is now one of the few signs to identify her remains . Helen Maldonado was murdered on the violent night of November 12, 2021, in Penitenciaría del Litoral de Ecuador. She died 17 days before her 29th birthday, while serving a 30-month prison sentence after a few grams of H.  Before the massacre, she and other trans-women asked for help. [Odalys  says that they knew that a new bloody attack was being prepared and they begged for their transfer from the Peni to the priority area of ​​the Regional prison a few meters away, where serving sentences is a little more bearable for the [LGBT+] population.  “Helen is just the voice of what we have asked the State for years: respect for identity, gender expression, clothing in the prison system. We are and were there - in men's prisons - because we have a penis; the rest don't matter to them ”.  Odalys directs the Trans Community Network of Ecuador Vivir Libre, which since 2017 has supported more than 200 transsexual women who were and are incarcerated for street fights, drug use or because they are accused of robbery by clients seeking sexual services. That is how she met Helen, in ward 6. She still does not know how she got to the transitional area, where she was massacred. The torture, says Odalys, begins much earlier, as soon as they set foot in the cells. “Being inside is a matter of survival, of existing and resisting. One way of resisting is prostitution, they are forced to be slaves of the system, to be mules… ”.Helen made her living as a hairdresser and sex worker and had been in prison for more than a year, serving a 30 month sentence in a men's prison for possession of a small quantity of heroin.  Diane Rodriguez , national director of the Ecuadorian Federation of LGBTI Organizations, recalls that Helen Maldonado arrived in Guayaquil and worked in a hairdresser and also worked as a sex worker. Helen was arrested for micro-trafficking of drugs and was serving a sentence of two and a half years, according to information published by the digital medium EdicionCientonce , which also indicates that in March 2022, Helen could request a change to the semi-open rehabilitation regime , which consists of to serve the rest of the sentence outside of prison with family, labor, social or community reintegration activities.  Although Helen was not an activist in the LGBTI community, ""she knew about and was linked to organizational spaces, but she did not articulate as an activist, "" says Diane. Community members who knew her, says Diane, remember that Helen was a shy person and that her arrest was a surprise, because she was not linked to any gang.  When the massacre started, Helen was able to call her mother and tell her what was happening, Diane recalls. Helen's mother and sister lived through the ordeal of families searching for the bodies of their loved ones. Both had to identify Helen's body, first among the remains of those who were dismembered, not finding her there, they were taken with the cremated bodies, where they recognized her body.  According to a report published in Indómita , one day before the massacre, “Helen Brigitte took a photo, in profile, smiling, loose hair, shorts and a red, white and blue striped diver and sent it by WhatsApp to a group of friends with two words: ""I'm fine ."" Shots had already been heard all week in the Penitentiary.  Despite the fact that Helen was a trans woman, she was being held in a men's prison. Their story is a ""voice"", Odalys Cayambe , director of the trans organization Vivir Libres, told local media. The mistreatment that Helen received as a person of gender diversity, also happens with 60 other trans women who are in the Penitentiary , according to Cayambe told Indómita .",2021.0,El

La Pocha,28.0,2021-10-01,Guayas,Ecuador,-2.188292,-79.9237322,violence,stabbed,"A homeless #trans woman was found with two stab wounds - allegedly inflicted by a man she had a relationship with. She identified only by the alias ""La Pocha"". A 34-year-old transgender woman received two stab wounds next to the bridge that connects avendas José María Velasco and 17, near a section of the Salado estuary boardwalk, in western Guayaquil.  On the morning of this Friday 1, the victim was identified by the residents as alias La Pocha, who allegedly had a sentimental relationship with the man who attacked her with a knife after an argument.  The body, which has two wounds on the neck, was picked up by Legal Medicine and transferred to the Criminalistics and Forensic Sciences Laboratory, on Rodríguez Bonín Avenue.  Neighbors commented that La Pocha apparently had consumption problems and lived on the street with her partner, who is main suspect. The Police are looking for the subject.  According to figures from the Center for the Promotion and Action of Women (Cepam-Guayaquil), at least seven crimes of this type, considered transfemicides, have been registered this year at the national level.

Selena Reyes-Hernandez,37.0,2020-05-31,Illinois,United States of America,41.7643935,-87.7071772,violence,shot,"Selena was shot by a man who went home with her after she told him that she was transgender. Even though she was dead already, he later returned to shoot her again.Orlando Perez, 18, was remanded in custody without bail. He is next due to appear in court on 6th July. An 18-year-old high school student was allegedly so upset after finding out a woman he went home with was transgender that he killed her. Even after firing his gun twice at Selena Reyes-Hernandez, Orlando Perez confessed to detectives that he went back to Reyes-Hernandez’s Marquette Park residence a second time so he could shoot her lifeless body again, Cook County prosecutors said Tuesday. Perez allegedly told detectives during a video-recorded statement that while inside, he asked Reyes-Hernandez if she was a girl. When she said she was trans, he told her he had to leave. Surveillance cameras show Perez leaving 20 minutes later, and then returning around 6 a.m. with a dark face covering, prosecutors said. The video allegedly shows Perez take out a handgun and rack the slide as he approaches Reyes-Hernandez’s home in the 3300 block of West 71st Street. Perez was also recorded hopping over the gate to Reyes-Hernandez’s home and then leaving again minutes later, prosecutors said. Perez allegedly told detectives after finding the victim’s door open, he walked in and shot her in the head and back. “He thought that was enough so he ran out. But he kept seeing her face, so he went back there to do it again,” Assistant State’s Attorney James Murphy said during Perez’s bond hearing. Perez shot Reyes-Hernandez’s body several more times while she lay face down on the floor, prosecutors said.

Maria Eduarda Aires Dias,32.0,2020-02-23,Rio Grande do Sul,Brazil,-30.543307,-52.522351,violence,murdered,"Maria's decomposing body was found dumped in a thicket along with that of her partner Paulo Ricardo Cardoso Carvalho, 45. Both had been gagged and had their hands and feet tied. The Civil Police of Encruzilhada do Sul launched an investigation to investigate the death of Maria Eduarda Aires Dias, 32, a transgender woman from Cachoeira do Sul whose body was found gagged and with hands and feet tied on Sunday (23), in the locality of Passo do Elias, interior of the municipality. In addition to it, the body of a man identified as Paulo Ricardo Cardoso Carvalho, 45, born in Encruzilhada, was also located at the same location and under the same conditions. As the two bodies were in an advanced state of decomposition, it was not initially possible to identify the cause of the deaths. The corpses were collected and sent for necropsy. The two deaths are treated by the police as homicide and feminicide, as Maria Eduarda had recently changed her name and gender in her identification documents. The General Institute of Forensics should forward a report to the Civil Police in the next few days with the first notes of technical evidence collected at the crime scene. The police are also expected to start collecting the first eight witnesses this week as part of the investigation launched to investigate the murders.Police believe that they had been killed elsewhere.

Andresa Santos,36.0,2021-04-24,Amazonas,Brazil,-3.129831717,-60.02596743,violence,beaten,"Andresa's body was found by police officers conducting a routine patrol. She had been beaten with a piece of wood. Manaus / AM - A [trans woman], identified so far only as 'Joelma', was murdered at dawn this Saturday (24th), at around 1 am, on Rua 10 de Julho with Lobo D'Almada, in the Centro district, in the south of Manaus.  According to information provided by the team from the 24th Companhia Interativa Comunitária (Cicom), which answered the incident, the police officers were doing a routine patrol when they noticed a body lying on the floor at the address mentioned.  When they decided to get out of the car and get closer, they realized it was a possible homicide. The police quickly dispatched the team from the Mobile Emergency Service (Samu), who arrived at the scene and confirmed the death.  Police at the scene had information that the [trans woman] had possibly  been beaten several times before she died.  While the Department of Scientific Technical Police (DPTC) were at the scene undertaking forensic work on the body they found a piece of wood covered by bloodstains, indicating that was indeed beaten.Subsequent reports named ""Joelma"" as Andresa Santos and gave some background about her. Andresa Santos was a woman full of dreams. She told her family that she wanted to go to Aesthetics College, because she liked the idea of ​​being able to change bodies. She also wanted to start the process of gender reassignment, and even went on to do some medical consultations. But her biggest dream was not to die early, as [trans women in Brazil] have a life expectancy of only 35 years because of the violence to which they are exposed. Despite all of this, Andresa was beaten to death on Saturday (24), in the center of Manaus, at the age of 36.  ""She went out that night to have fun. She said 'I'm going there', but she didn't come back. Then we found out that she had been murdered. They ended my sister's story. They destroyed her dreams,"" reports the victim's sister, Evalcilene Santos, in an exclusive interview to EM TEMPO . When she thinks of her sister, all Evalcilene can say is how dreamy the young woman was. Andresa lived in Maués (municipality 259 km from Manaus), but moved to the capital in November 2020, already running away from prejudice.  ""In the countryside, people called her male and she didn't like it. She wanted to be called Andresa and respected for that. When she came to Manaus, she started wanting to study and change her life, but it was very difficult without having a job because of the pandemic"", said Evalcilene.Andresa's

She had been missing since 6th November.Jade was a community leader who lived in Lolotiquillo and was creating a transgender women's collective in San Francisco Gotera, the provincial capital of Morazán state. She had also worked on forced displacement and migration issues, which particularly affect the trans community. Jade, a transgender woman who had been missing since Wednesday, was found murdered in the Torola River, in a section of the channel that passes between the municipalities of Osicala and Meanguera in the department of Morazán. Her body was seen in the river by residents who circulated around the place and gave notice to the National Civil Police (PNC) this Saturday morning. Her photograph had been disseminated through social networks this week in an attempt to gain clues to her whereabouts. Attorney General Raul Melara also shared the alert and said that the institution's teams were active in the search. “DISAPPEARED - Jade Camila Díaz, was last seen on November 6 at 6:00 pm when she left her house dressed in blue shorts and a white tank top. Any information, at 2564 5029 or on the COMCAVIS TRANS EL SALVADOR Fanpage”, was read in the image disseminated by the non-governmental organization that has represented trans women in the country for a little over a decade. On the morning of that Wednesday when Jade would be last seen alive, Attorney General Raul Melara spoke of ""an approximate eight daily complaints"" of disappearances in El Salvador and mentioned that in the first six days of November they had warned of 23 missing people. But he assured that a ""considerable percentage are found alive."" “Not all the disappeared end up in homicide, many of the disappeared are because they migrated to another country, especially to the United States, others appear in the day, others left with the boyfriend or girlfriend, escaped from home, left home, other elders have been found on the street, there are a variety of reasons why a person disappears, ” President Nayib Bukele also said in a message on the first day of November in which he highlighted the reduction in murders achieved in his administration and in He who tried to explain that the disappearance of a person in El Salvador is not synonymous with death, only in a part of the cases, such as Jade's.  Several Twitter accounts of people involved in defending the rights of the LGBTI community (lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals and intersexuals) ensure that the body had signs of torture. The PNC has not confirmed the information. They did reveal that part of their body was inserted in a bag, within which there were stones. Jade, whose name according to the National Registry of Natural Persons (RNPN) is [deadname] Díaz, resided in the municipality of Lolotiquillo, near the location where she was found dead. Just two weeks ago, the LGBTI community had been beaten with the murder of another of its members on Los Heroes Boulevard in San Salvador. The crime transcended by the particularity with which it had been committed, because the victim, held from a vehicle, was dragged along the road to her death.Jade Camila Diaz was the 47th trans person

They had been decapitated, partially burned and dismembered.Juan Antonio Martinez Matos, 26, confessed to the murder. Reportedly he killed them after discovering that they were not a cisgender woman. Finding accurate information to identify murder victims as trans or killed because of their gender presentation is a consistent challenge. Just this week the brutal murder of Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado was reported as that of a “gay teen” with male pronouns used when referring to Lopez Mercado. There has been very little coverage of the fact that Lopez Mercado was a sex worker with a female presentation. Murder suspect Juan antonio Martinez Matos said he thought Lopez Mercado was female but then “realized that the teenager was actually male.”  I don’t know how Lopez Mercado identified, but Martinez Matos’ statement tells us that they didn’t conform to his strict understanding of gender: Martinez Matoz thought Lopez Mercado was female and then changed his opinion, the reason given for the murder. So Lopez Mercado’s name has been added to the list of those we remember.",2009.0,Cayey,1,"['jorge', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'on', 'an', 'isolated', 'road', 'they', 'had', 'been', 'decapitated', 'partially', 'burned', 'and', 'dismembered', 'juan', 'antonio', 'martinez', 'matos', '26', 'confessed', 'to', 'the', 'murder', 'reportedly', 'he', 'killed', 'them', 'after', 'discovering', 'that', 'they', 'were', 'not', 'a', 'cisgender', 'woman', 'finding', 'accurate', 'information', 'to', 'identify', 'murder', 'victims', 'as', 'trans', 'or', 'killed', 'because', 'of', 'their', 'gender', 'presentation', 'is', 'a', 'consistent', 'challenge', 'just', 'this', 'week', 'the', 'brutal', 'murder', 'of', 'jorge', 'steven', 'lopez', 'mercado', 'was', 'reported', 'as', 'that', 'of', 'a', 'gay', 'teen', 'with', 'male', 'pronouns', 'used', 'when', 'referring', 'to', 'lopez', 'mercado', 'there', 'has', 'been', 'very', 'little', 'coverage', 'of', 'the', 'fact', 'that', 'lopez', 'mercado', 'was', 'a', 'sex', 'worker', 'with', 'a', 'female', 'presentation', 'murder', 'suspect', 'juan', 'antonio', 'martinez', 'matos', 'said', 'he', 'thought', 'lopez', 'mercado', 'was', 'female', 'but', 'then', 'realized', 'that', 'the', 'teenager', 'was', 'actually', 'male', 'i', 'don', 't', 'know', 'how', 'lopez', 'mercado', 'identified', 'but', 'martinez', 'matos', 'statement', 'tells', 'us', 'that', 'they', 'didn', 't', 'conform', 'to', 'his', 'strict', 'understanding', 'of', 'gender', 'martinez', 'matoz', 'thought', 'lopez', 'mercado', 'was', 'female', 'and', 'then', 'changed', 'his', 'opinion', 'the', 'reason', 'given', 'for', 'the', 'murder', 'so', 'lopez', 'mercado', 's', 'name', 'has', 'been', 'added', 'to', 'the', 'list', 'of', 'those', 'we', 'remember']",jorge wa found dead on an isolated road they had been decapitated partially burned and dismembered juan antonio martinez matos 26 confessed to the murder reportedly he killed them after discovering that they were not a cisgender woman finding accurate information to identify murder victim a trans or killed because of their gender presentation is a consistent challenge just this week the brutal murder of jorge steven lopez mercado wa reported a that of a gay teen with male pronoun used when referring to lopez mercado there ha been very little coverage of the fact that lopez mercado wa a sex worker with a female presentation murder suspect juan antonio martinez matos said he thought lopez mercado wa female but then realized that the teenager wa actually male i don t know how lopez mercado identified but martinez matos statement tell u that they didn t conform to his strict understanding of gender martinez matoz thought lopez mercado wa female and then changed his opinion the reason given for the murder so lopez mercado s name ha been added to the list of those we remember

Paula Migeon,50.0,2021-04-07,Champagne-Ardenne,France,49.2695782,4.0202931,violence,raped and stabbed,"Paula was raped and stabbed in her own home. Her killer then set the property ablaze in an attempt to try to conceal the crime.Jean-Paul Isaki, 27, was subsequently arrested. A 27-year-old young man was indicted on Friday following the murder of a 50-year-old who was found slaughtered on April 7 during a fire in [her] apartment on avenue de Laon in Reims. The victim was raped before being killed. The homophobic nature of the crime is being taken into account by the courts.  Just days after the death of a 51-year-old [trans woman] found slaughtered during the fire in [her] apartment on avenue de Laon, in Reims, on the evening of April 7, the alleged perpetrator was preparing this Friday evening to spend his first night in prison. Presented in the afternoon at the education center in Reims, a 27-year-old Congolese man, Jean-Paul Isaki, was indicted for ""rape and murder committed because of sexual orientation or identity of the victim” . In the current state of investigations, the current hypothesis of that a homophobic crime.  The suspect was also indicted for the arson of the apartment, as well as for the theft and fraudulent use of the victim's bank card.  The naked body of the fifty-year-old, mutilated from fourteen stab wounds to the throat and cervical area, had been discovered by firefighters at the entrance to [her] bathroom in which the fire had been lit with an accelerant, such as a cleaning product. domesticated. Alerted by the smell of burning, a neighbor had seen someone come out of the apartment. The police officers of the SRPJ of Reims had only this single testimony at the very beginning of the investigation. Quite quickly, however, technical investigations made it possible to trace a suspect through the use of the bank card stolen from the victim, in particular for Uber Eats and Airbnb payments.  A name then appeared: that of Jean-Paul Isaki, domiciled in  but frequently in the Paris region. It was in an Airbnb room in Évry (Essonne) that the PJ arrested him on Thursday morning. Today, it is time for us to support Paula's family in this terrible mourning following this abject crime of April 7, 2021 in Reims. In 25 years of existence, the association has always defended our right to exist. Unfortunately, with every new atrocity, awaken in us very strong feelings, where each of us recognizes ourselves once again, once again: ′′ This could have happened to me"" ′ Never again! Our lives are valuable!"" We can only suffer and allow these cries to be inclined in the banality of various facts. That's why we decided to act by being with Paula's family throughout the investigation and in the upcoming trial, by building a Civil Party ourselves. Mourad BENKOUSSA, a criminal lawyer at ACG firm, has agreed to assist Paula's family and our association in this constitution of civil parties. While waiting for justice to do its work, we invite you to join us this Saturday, April 24, 2021 at 10 p.m. Place Saint Thomas in Reims. Her family, living on the Perpignan Region, will be physically there alongside LGBT Scotia from 11 onwards. Paula's ordeal is sadly part of the history of the LGBTQI community. But we will fight, through the legal channels, alongside her family, to ensure that such ignominies are part of the past and that such acts are punished up to what they are. Since 2017, the law has created an aggravating crime against any person ""in consideration of the victim or group of persons of which the victim is a member on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation or gender identity true or supposed"". This aggravating circumstance has been held against Paula's alleged perpetrator. Association Exaequo, LGBT+ Reims Center since 1996, wishes to publicly recall the importance of respecting the wishes of the victim who had come out as a woman trans to her family. To quote her niece Laura's words: ′′ My uncle said she was a woman born into the wrong body.

Silvana Gómez Galeano,25.0,2021-04-25,Huila,Colombia,2.9376189,-75.3074082,medical,cosmetic filler complications,"Silvana died in Hospital Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo after undergoing an unofficial cosmetic procedure on her buttocks. Vanity and the desire to feel beautiful was the direct route to death for a young 25-year-old [trans woman], who was injected with cosmetic silicone in her buttocks but her body did not resist. The aesthetic procedure was performed in a barber shop in the city of Neiva.  Silvana Gómez Galeano, as she was known in the LGTBI community, lost her life after undergoing an aesthetic procedure in an unauthorized site and under the direction of an unknowledgeable person.  “We arrived at the place on Sunday afternoon; It is a beauty parlor located in the Monserrate neighborhood; She had the appointment at 3:00 in the afternoon, when we started, I told her to be calm that everything was going to be fine. The girl in charge of injecting her, applied anesthesia, almost two anesthesia syringes, then began to inject the silicone, there were 3 syringes in each buttock, but when she was on the second on the right side, she began to feel ill,"" he said Sara, Silvana's best friend.  The 25-year-old trans young woman repeatedly told her companions that she could not breathe, for a few minutes they stopped thinking that it would be something normal, but as the hours went by it became more complicated, “she began to turn purple She was restless, she said she couldn't breathe, she cried a lot, she was desperate, and that's when the tragedy began”. They quickly transferred her to the Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo Hospital, but upon entering, the doctors told her of her serious health condition; however, clinging to life, she tried to breathe on her own, until it was necessary to put oxygen on her and hours later to intubate her.  The liquid that they applied to Silvana on the buttocks had reached her lungs, meaning that one or more arteries in the lungs were blocked by a blood clot and while the doctors tried to save her, her body did not resist anymore and she died.  The place where the illegal aesthetic procedure was performed is located in the Monserrate neighborhood, in the east of the city of Neiva; According to relatives of the victim, it was the 'Barbería Jaminton', and a woman who works there charged the young woman a considerable sum of money to inject her with the substance to enlarge her buttocks.",2021.0,Neiva,0,"['silvana', 'died', 'in',

Keyshia Blige,33.0,2015-03-07,Illinois,United States of America,41.75527,-88.309507,violence,shot and crashed,"Keyshia was shot in the shoulder while driving a friend through Aurora's South Side in the early hours of 7th March. She crashed the car and died at the scene.Her murder was not reported as being that of a trans woman until 5 months later in August. Even as people were gathering in 20 cities across the United States for the Aug. 25 Trans Liberation Tuesday event to stand up for and acknowledge the then-18 transgender women murdered in 2015, news stories began to break about an Aurora, Illinois, woman named Keyshia Blige. But the incident had not occurred earlier in the day, over the prior weekend or even during the month of August.  Blige was killed in the early hours of March 7. A statement from the Aurora Police Department reached WGN news which reported the incident that afternoon. The Aurora Beacon News—part of the Chicago Tribune Media Group—followed with a more detailed article March 24. The Aurora PD and both WGN and The Beacon News referred to Blige as a male and used her birth name. The Beacon News noted in their report that Blige had recently begun transitioning.  It was five-months later, on Aug. 23, when Elizabeth Marie Rivera—the creator of the Trans Social Butterfly Network—corrected both the Aurora PD and The Beacon News in a Facebook post.  Outrage followed as it became clear that Blige had been revictimized due to the failure of both the Aurora PD and the media to correctly report her gender and her name.Her best friend Sasha Love told the Guardian that Blige identified as transgender and used female pronouns: “She was the happiest I had ever seen her once she started transitioning,” Love recalled to the Guardian. Love said that Blige first began realizing her identity once they started performing in drag in the late-2010s. They had both been attracted to it not only because they liked to dress up, but because they had learned how to lip-synch while growing up in their church choir.  “When she would dress up, she would tell me ‘I love being Keyshia. I want to be Keyshia,” Love said. The two performed at weekly shows outside the city of Chicago, where Love was the host, too.  But Blige’s attitude changed on 24 June 2011 when she was the victim of a hate crime in a neighboring city, when four men attacked her for being gay – hitting her 30 times, he told police – and leaving her with nerve damage to the face. The four men were later convicted or pleaded guilty to the hate crime. All men were ordered to pay restitution, according to the Chicago Tribune.  “For a while she stopped doing shows because of the hate crime and she gained more weight,” Love told the Guardian. “She was more concerned with her weight and how she looks, and stopped dressing up.”  Late last year, after significant weight loss and renewed confidence, she started doing shows more and began coming out as transgender, Love said.  “At first when her family found out, they were like: Oh my god, what is [she] doing?” she said, “but I think once they realized that [Keyshia] is going to do what [Keyshia] is going to do, they got better. Her family they were coming around to the point where they were coming around”.Keyshia's ",2015.0,Aurora,1,"['keyshia', 'was', 'shot', 'in', 'the', 'shoulder', 'while', 'driving', 'a', 'friend',

C. do Nascimento Rolim,19.0,2016-10-13,Sao Paulo,Brazil,-23.550651,-46.633382,violence,asphyxiated,"C. was found dead inside an unattended police car parked in the 77th Police District (PD), in Santa Cecilia, in the center of São Paulo. Her death was ruled “suspicious”.According to the ombudsman of the São Paulo State Police, Julio Cesar Neves, the “story was badly told”. The ombudsman wants to know if there has been an irregularity committed by a police officer. “It’s appalling to see a body inside a police car inside a police station parking lot and the Civil Police does not explain it right.” A [trans woman] who did not have her identity revealed was found dead late Thursday morning (13) inside a vehicle of the Civil Police of Sao Paulo. The case happened in the 77th Police District, located at Glete Mall, 827, in the Santa Cecília neighborhood, west of the state capital.

Kyara Barbosa,23.0,2017-12-04,Ceara,Brazil,-5.09736,-38.370158,suicide,suicide,"Kyara died by suicide. According to friends she suffered from severe depression.She was politically active and a skilled writer who had written messages about the difficult lives of Brazilian transgender people: **ON THE CHANGES AND IDENTITIES** By Kyara Barbosa  According to medicine and society I was born a boy, but I never identified myself as such. By the age of 11 I was already affectionately related to boys, I did not feel in a homo relationship. At age 14 Kyara was born, of everything that existed inside the box, being woman was the one that approached me more. Even though I felt fulfilled by assuming a feminine identity and living in my reality this condition, I always felt that something was missing.  Now, at the age of 23 — nine years after starting my transition — I feel like I’m still at the beginning of everything; today I do not identify myself as a woman, and very much as a man. What I feel and I know is that my identity as a human being is not limited to gender binarism, but rather the possibilities. It remains a trans woman that for political reasons is claimed transvestite, more fundamentally, these issues of gender is a mere social illusion. I can be free without having a gender, in fact, if I want one.  I am a human being who thinks, who breathes and feels and that is enough for me.  My voice is too thick to be feminine, and damn, I love my voice. Just like my voice, my measurements do not fit within a standard and that’s what I think is beautiful: it’s not fit into standards. I feel like an unlimited human being, that I can have as many identities as I want, as many sexualities as I can, and none of this interferes directly with what I am. There are things I do not understand and do not want to understand, but only taste the freedom that has already been arrested.Her ",2017.0,Morada Nova,0,"['kyara', 'died', 'by', 'suicide', 'according', 'to', 'friends', 'she', 'suffered', 'from', 'severe', 'depression', 'she', 'was', 'politically', 'active', 'and', 'a', 'skilled', 'writer', 'who', 'had', 'written', 'messages', 'about', 'the', 'difficult', 'lives', 'of', 'brazilian', 'transgender', 'people', 'on', 'the', 'changes', 'and', 'identities', 'by', 'kyara', 'barbosa', 'according', 'to', 'medicine', 'and', 'society', 'i', 'was', 'born', 'a', 'boy', 'but', 'i', 'never', 'identified', 'myself', 'as', 'such', 'by', 'the', 'age', 'of', '11', 'i', 'was', 'already', 'affectionately', 'related', 'to', 'boys', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'in', 'a', 'homo', 'relationship', 'at', 'age', '14', 'kyara', 'was', 'born', 'of', 'everything', 'that', 'existed', 'inside', 'the', 'box', 'being', 'woman', 'was', 'the', 'one', 'that', 'approached', 'me', 'more', 'even', 'though', 'i', 'felt', 'fulfilled', 'by', 'assuming', 'a', 'feminine', 'identity', 'and', 'living', 'in', 'my', 'reality', 'this', 'condition', 'i', 'always', 'felt', 'that', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'now', 'at', 'the', 'age', 'of', '23', 'nine', 'years', 'after', 'starting', 'my', 'transition', 'i', 'feel', 'like', 'i', 'm', 'still', 'at', 'the', 'beginning', 'of', 'everything', 'today', 'i', 'do', 'not', 'identify', 'myself', 'as', 'a', 'woman', 'and', 'very', 'much', 'as', 'a', 'man', 'what', 'i', 'feel', 'and', 'i', 'know', 'is', 'that', 'my', 'identity', 'as', 'a', 'human', 'being', 'is', 'not', 'limited', 'to', 'gender', 'binarism', 'but', 'rather', 'the', 'possibilities', 'it', 'remains', 'a', 'trans', 'woman', 'that', 'for', 'political', 'reasons', 'is', 'claimed', 'transvestite', 'more', 'fundamentally', 'these', 'issues', 'of', 'gender', 'is', 'a', 'mere', 'social', 'illusion', 'i', 'can', 'be', 'free', 'without', 'having', 'a', 'gender', 'in', 'fact', 'if', 'i', 'want', 'one', 'i', 'am', 'a', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'thinks', 'who', 'breathes', 'and', 'feels', 'and', 'that', 'is', 'enough', 'for', 'me', 'my', 'voice', 'is', 'too', 'thick', 'to', 'be', 'feminine', 'and', 'damn', 'i', 'love', 'my', 'voice', 'just', 'like', 'my', 'voice', 'my', 'measurements', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'within', 'a', 'standard', 'and', 'that', 's', 'what', 'i', 'think', 'is', 'beautiful', 'it', 's', 'not', 'fit', 'into', 'standards', 'i', 'feel', 'like', 'an', 'unlimited', 'human', 'being', 'that', 'i', 'can', 'have', 'as', 'many', 'identities', 'as', 'i', 'want', 'as', 'many', 'sexualities', 'as', 'i', 'can', 'and', 'none', 'of', 'this', 'interferes', 'directly', 'with', 'what', 'i', 'am', 'there', 'are', 'things', 'i', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'and', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'to', 'understand', 'but', 'only', 'taste', 'the', 'freedom', 'that', 'has', 'already', 'been', 'arrested', 'her']",kyara died by suicide according to friend she suffered from severe depression she wa politically active and a skilled writer who had written message about the difficult life of brazilian transgender people on the change and identity by kyara barbosa according to medicine and society i wa born a boy but i never identified myself a such by the age of 11 i wa already affectionately related to boy i did not feel in a homo relationship at age 14 kyara wa born of everything that existed inside the box being woman wa the one that approached me more even though i felt fulfilled by assuming a feminine identity and living in my reality this condition i always felt that something wa missing now at the age of 23 nine year after starting my transition i feel like i m still at the beginning of everything today i do not identify myself a a woman and very much a a man what i feel and i know is that my identity a a human being is not limited to gender binarism but rather the possibility it remains a trans woman that for political reason is claimed transvestite more fundamentally these issue of gender is a mere social illusion i can be free without having a gender in fact if i want one i am a human being who think who breathes and feel and that is enough for me my voice is too thick to be feminine and damn i love my voice just like my voice my measurement do not fit within a standard and that s what i think is beautiful it s not fit into standard i feel like an unlimited human being that i can have a many identity a i want a many sexuality a i can and none of this interferes directly with what i am there are thing i do not understand and do not want to understand but only taste the freedom that ha already been arrested her

Before she died she was able to tell police where she met her killer and what kind of vehicle he drives.Clayton Hubbird, 31, has been charged with reckless homicide and is being sought by police. MILWAUKEE - Regina Allen, 35, of Milwaukee, known by friends as Mya, was fatally shot Aug. 29 near 26th and Wells. Police are looking for the man they say killed the transgender woman.

Yenifer León,33.0,2020-05-27,Moscow,Russian Federation,55.751634,37.618704,medical,COVID-19,"Yenifer died in hospital from viral pneumonia. She was visiting from Cuba, became trapped in Moscow during the pandemic lockdown and then ran out of money for her HIV medication. Yenifer, 33, had come to Moscow from Cuba ""on a shopping spree,"" as she told a newspaper on April 22. It was the second time. The previous one, a couple of years ago, brought three suitcases loaded with T-shirts, underwear and kitchenware to the island. The 120 kilos of rigor in goods that the authorities allow Cubans to take to the country. On the island, where the shortage of products increases in value, she sold the material and made a profit. She wanted to repeat the operation to which a good part of the 25,000 Cubans who enter Russia each year are dedicated, and which has become so frequent that it has illuminated an entire irregular infrastructure - housing in flats, transportation, procedures, passages - around to that business. But the pandemic came. The closing of borders. The self-isolation regime in the Russian capital. The digital pass system to move around the city. Yenifer and thousands of other Cubans were stranded in Moscow. And she ran out of money. And the antiretroviral drugs she was taking. And the roach-filled apartment she lived in was coming down on him. I was worried. Unlike many other Cubans who come to Russia to stay - some, deceived by the mafias with the promise of a job or the commitment to cross them to Europe - Yenifer wanted to return to the Caribbean island. She had insistently called the Cuban consulate without receiving any response, she said. She was afraid of the police, of discrimination for being trans, black, and having HIV. ""I can not take anymore. On Monday I will request discharge, ”said one of the last messages from the AE Rabujin tuberculosis hospital in Moscow. ""Blessings! They already did the analyzes and the plates, now to wait for results, ”said another, edged with emoticons. her favorite: the little face that sends a heart-shaped kiss. On May 5 she began to feel bad. A journey then began through the ins and outs of the Russian health system that ends with those unanswered calls to her mobile. Yenifer was admitted to Moscow's infectious hospital number 2. It was suspected that she could be infected with coronavirus, but the tests were negative. She was diagnosed with viral pneumonia but from other causes, she then explained by phone. She was there for 23 days. She did not speak Russian and could only communicate with the Google translator, says Anna Voronkova, a volunteer who collaborates independently to help the Cuban community. “Sher case exemplifies that if you don't know the language or the rules, if you don't know how to navigate the paper bureaucracy, it's as if you don't have rights. And even more so if you are a trans woman in a country like Russia, ”says Voronkova, who regrets the low collaboration of the Cuban consular authorities.in a time of need for the global health crisis. The system thus rests precariously on the shoulders of volunteers and specialized NGOs without which the most vulnerable would not have assistance. On March 22, when she thought she was going to be discharged, she was sent to the Rabujin Hospital. She had been diagnosed with tuberculosis. She remained there for five days. When Voronkova called the center less than a week later, she was told that she had died a few hours ago. That she had two-thirds of her lungs badly damaged. Her family is still waiting for more information from the Cuban consular authorities. ""We are devastated, nobody tells us anything,"" laments her mother, Carmen Cárdenas, by phone from Jovellanos, east of Havana. She was a single mother, she says, and although she has another daughter and is a great support, she was very close to Yenifer. She explains that she wants to repatriate the body and her belongings, but that she cannot explain if it is possible and how.",2020.0,Moscow,0,"['yenifer', 'died', 'in', 'hospital', 'from', 'viral',

Diamond Kyree Sanders/Diamond Nicole,23.0,2021-03-03,Ohio,United States of America,39.1413956,-84.5313402,violence,shot,"Diamond was found in a parking lot suffering from a gunshot wound. She died in hospital. She was 23-years-old, born and raised in Cincinnati. On March 3, she became the latest Black trans woman murdered in the U.S.  Her name was Diamond Kyree Sanders. She also was known as Diamond Nicole.  Cincinnati police responded to a report of a person shot on Morrison Avenue around 3:42 a.m., according to a Wednesday afternoon news release. They discovered the wounded 23-year-old Kyree Sanders in a parking lot. Firefighters took Sanders to a hospital, where she died.  Police at first said it might have been a bias crime, then claimed it was ‘greed’ because her purse was stolen. I still don’t understand why the police are so quick to jump to conclusions about motive when they haven’t even caught the murderer. They don’t know the shooter was the one who stole her purse. Or that it was the motive rather than a hasty decision, perhaps to delay identifying the victim? I’m not clear on why it took so long for her death to be acknowledged by the media.  Diamond studied at The Ohio State University and had recently been working at Nordstrom.  She had thousands of friends on Facebook and her timeline was filled many cute, fashionable photos. The obituary written by her family speaks volumes to her dynamic personality and how much she was loved. Her 24th birthday would have been on April 10.Diamond's obituary reads: “Diamond was a ball of energy as a child and even up to her time of death. She valued her family and enjoyed spending time with them. As a child, she would say “I love my WHOLE family!” At the last family Thanksgiving dinner, Diamond let her family know she was thankful that they accepted her for who she was as a transgender. In her younger years, Diamond spent many weekends with her Aunt Terron and Grandmother Dianne, baking cookies and making one of her favorite meals, “pigs in a blanket”. They also took Diamond and her siblings on trips to the Bahamas, Florida (Walt Disney World), Detroit and Gatlinburg to show her the world is much bigger than just Cincinnati.”  “As an adult, Diamond was a traveler, known to be in New York City one week and New Orleans the following week. Diamond was really into fashion. She always coordinated her attire from head to toe, including matching hair and nails. She was known to say, “I have to be cute, honey!” A few weeks before her death she was in her grandmother’s closet putting on her fur coat, clothes, and jewelry. Diamond’s unique style, charm, and personality will be greatly missed.”Franchez Rivers, 33, Christopher Hisle, 28, and Kiara Davis, 29. were subsequently indicted for her murder: An attorney for one of three people charged in the March killing of a 23-year-old transgender woman in Clifton told a judge Thursday ""there is more to this case."" At an arraignment Thursday for Franchez Rivers, Hamilton County Municipal Judge William Mallory set bond for Rivers at $2 million. The 33-year-old Spring Grove Village resident was arrested Wednesday, court records say. Rivers was one of three people indicted Thursday by a Hamilton County grand jury in the March 3 fatal shooting of Diamond Kyree Sanders. The others charged are: Christopher Hisle, 28, and Kiara Davis, 29. Hisle has been in the Hamilton County Justice Center since April, after being arrested for illegally carrying a loaded gun in an incident unrelated to Sanders' death. Hisle had a previous felony conviction at the time. He pleaded guilty Sept. 8 to felony charges including carrying a concealed weapon. He also is charged with possessing ""a large amount of marijuana."" That case is still pending. Davis was arrested and jailed Thursday, records show. Rivers, Hisle and Davis are charged with murder, aggravated robbery and felonious assault.

Kayla Moore,41.0,2013-02-12,California,United States of America,37.869058,-122.270455,custodial,died in custody,"Kayla died in the custody of Berkely police after a mental health call.The police said in a report released after her death that she was combative with officers who went to her home that night, and officers needed to restrain her. Once she stopped breathing, officers removed the restraints, performed CPR and took her to a hospital, but she died there a short time later. More than five years after a paranoid schizophrenic transgender woman died in police custody, a federal judge has tossed out the lawsuit her family filed for wrongful death.  The family of Kayla Moore alleged in the lawsuit filed in 2014 against the city of Berkeley that six officers used excessive force and suffocated Moore by holding her down on a futon during a struggle after they were called to an Allston Way apartment on Feb. 12, 2013, for a mental health check. The city however, contended that minimal and appropriate force was used and sought a dismissal of the lawsuit in federal court, which was granted last week.  In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer agreed with the city, and ruled that Moore’s father, Arthur Moore, did not provide enough evidence to show that his daughter was discriminated against related to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The judge had previously dismissed the excessive force and discrimination claims alleged by Moore’s family back in 2016.  In his ruling, the judge states he initially thought there would be issues related to the ADA claims that could be tried: that officers mistakenly arrested Kayla Moore because they took the effects of her disability as a crime, and did not reasonably accommodate her disability during the arrest, the judge wrote.  The family had alleged in their lawsuit that officers did not administer CPR because she was transgender, and that officers made discriminatory comments about her, calling her “it.”  But the judge ruled Arthur Moore did not put forward sufficient evidence to support those claims. He said that no reasonable juror could find that Arthur Moore had met his burden of proving the city failed to accommodate Kayla Moore, or that it was a discriminatory arrest.Kayla's death was not

She was an asylum seeker who had fled El Salvador in 2017 after suffering transphobic violence and persecution by maras (gangs). Josselin, a 29-year-old trans woman of Salvadoran origin who had requested asylum in this country and lived in zone 7 of Guatemala City, was murdered at her home. Her mother found her, with multiple blows and a disfigured face on the morning of Saturday, August 1.   Josselin engaged in the informal clothing and makeup trade in the market in the same area. She had been living between Guatemala and El Salvador for 12 years, where she was constantly traveling with her mother when in 2018, due to persecution by gangs and violence in El Salvador due to the lack of recognition of her gender identity, she requested refuge in Guatemala. This was reported to Presentes Carlos Valdez, a member of Lambda Guatemala (Organization for Equality, Dignity and Human Rights of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexual Men and Women, Trans and Intersex Men and Women of Guatemala). Until the date of her death there was no resolution from the Guatemalan Migration Institute, she says. Lambda had been supporting Josselin because of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis with housing and food.The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) condemned her murder. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) expressed its dismay at the violent death of a Salvadoran transsexual woman, who, for having suffered violence due to her gender identity and gang persecution in El Salvador, had requested an asylum process in Guatemala.  In a statement, UNHCR explained that the woman's body was found on August 1 at her home in Guatemala City and that she had escaped from El Salvador, after she was the victim of violence.  In this regard, they call on the Guatemalan authorities ""to thoroughly investigate death in view of their commitment to protect people from the LGBTI community and people who request international protection in the country.""

KARACHI: An elderly transgender person was found dead in Karachi on Tuesday, police said. The tortured body of Haji Hajan was found in the water tank of her home in Bilal Colony, Korangi by members of the transgender community. According to SHO Awami Colony police station, the body was shifted to Jinnah hospital for medico-legal formalities and further investigation.  Speaking to The Express Tribune, transgender activist Bindiya Rana from Gender Interactive Alliance (GIA) said the bloodsoaked body was discovered by her chela (apprentice) at around 8pm.  “Amma Hajjani’s relatives found the doors of her house open and her valuables scattered… they were unable to find her as she was missing for two to three hours,” she said. “After searching everywhere, her chela found the body. The body had bruises on the head as if she was hit by an iron.” According to Rana, a violent incident from the area had been reported last year as well. “Incidents of violence and harassment are common in the area and rarely reported to the police,” she added. “The transgender community are forced to live in this area, mostly home to bachelors from outside of Karachi, because they are not allowed to rent homes elsewhere.” Hajjani, Rana added, lived alone in her rented house and used to survive on donations given by the community. “Amma Hajjani loved animals and kept a lot of goats as pets,” she said. “She accommodated many transgenders at her place…the transgender community of the area is in a state of shock.” She had been living in Karachi for 40 years. However, was laid to rest by immediate family members in her ancestral town, Qambar city in rural Sindh, on Wednesday. While the family has refused to conduct a postmortem or even register an FIR of the incident, transgender activists want to pursue the murder case. The plight of transgender persons has often been highlighted by activists and the civil society.

SHe had been shot in the chest, had numerous stab wounds in the back and dorsal area and a bruise covering her right eye. Fernanda ""Coty"" Olmos was a beloved neighbor of the Alfonso neighborhood of Santa Fe. She had spearheaded complaints from the residents of the neighborhood and in particular, she stood out for her supportive work during the dramatic floods that affected the city in 2003. On Friday afternoon, Fernanda was murdered in her humble home. A friend called 911 when she found the door ajar and a policeman found her dead body by the side of the bed. She had suffered blows to his face, several stabs on his neck, deep stab wounds on his back and abdomen, and a .22 caliber bullet in his chest.

Allan Montemayor, 32, has been arrested for her murder. LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - Cypress Ramos’ friends are demanding justice, after the 21-year-old’s body was found in a storage unit Saturday. The murder warrant for 32-year-old Allan Montemayor reveals information about the death. The warrant says Cypress died after being struck with a hard object. Police records show that Montemayor says he believed a song told him to kill Cypress but also believed that Cypress heard a song with instructions to kill Montemayor.  Cypress’ friend, Camilla Urbina, isn’t buying Montemayor’s story and wants justice. “He tried to burn my friend, literally. Like burn, burn them up,” Camilla said.  Police say security camera video captured Montemayor’s truck at the storage unit near the 2700 block of North Frankford Ave. on Saturday. He and someone else entered the storage unit, but an hour and 20 minutes later, he came out alone and drove off. Investigators tracked him down and say they found blood on his legs. “And there was blood on his pants, I believe that something else happened. And the truth will come out. And you will pay, promise,” Camilla said.  Montemayor told police he had been in the bathroom and when he came out he saw Cypress had set a fire. He then said Cypress “came at him with a bat...and it was either me or [her]”  [A friend of Cypress] doesn’t believe that’s what happened. “She is not that strong to even hit a person with a crowbar or a four-by-four or whatever it was that hit him when he was out of the restroom.

PESHAWAR: A man shot dead a transgender person in Jangi Mohallah area in the limits of Khan Raziq police station here on Friday.  It was the third such incident of targeting transgender persons in the province in less than a week.  A police official told Dawn that the slain transgender person identified as Mano was friends with a local identified as Sanaullah.  He said that Sanaullah got married sometime back and Mano was not happy over [her] friend’s marriage and would quarrel with him. He said that on Friday Sanaullah allegedly shot dead Mano after an argument and fled the scene.  Police have registered an FIR against the suspect.Subsequently it emerged that Sanaullah had shot Mano dead after she asked him to repay money he had borrowed from her. She was buried by her community after her birth family refused to accept her body. For many days before her death, Mano, a trans woman from Peshawar, had been fretting about her expenses. Weddings were a major source of income for her and she was worried that, with the onset of Ramazan, she wouldn’t be making any money for about a month. She had a way out, but it was a difficult one. A man she had previously been romantically involved with had borrowed a sum of over Rs800,000 from her: if she could get it back, she wouldn’t have to worry about money for the foreseeable future. She decided to give it a try.Last Friday afternoon, Mano made her way to a printing press in Peshawar’s Mohallah Jangi area, next to the historic Qissa Khwani Bazaar. This press was owned by Sanaullah, her former acquaintance. She approached him and explained her predicament; why she wanted her money back. He turned her down and told her to get lost, but she made it clear she wasn’t going to leave without the money she was owed. Enraged at her persistence, Sanaullah shot her dead. He escaped through the labyrinthine streets of the area. Mano’s family, which hails from the Batkhela area of Malakand, refused to even accept her body, leaving it to the local transgender community to arrange her last rites. Arzoo Khan, president of the Transgender Association KP, told Dawn that Mano’s family refused to take part in her burial, saying they wanted nothing to do with her either in life or in death. “We had to arrange people to bathe her body. Our neighbours shouldered her coffin to the graveyard where she was laid to rest.”",2022.0,Peshawar,1,"['mano', 'was', 'shot', 'dead', 'by', 'her', 'ex', 'partner', 'after', 'he', 'became', 'violent',

She was homeless and an activist for the Landless Rural Workers Movement of the state of Pernambuco. The Landless Rural Workers Movement of the state of Pernambuco deplores the murder of militant Aline da Silva, a landless [i.e. homeless] [trans woman] who lived in the Malhada camp in the municipality of Arcoverde (PE). Aline was part of the Youth Collective and was a young woman active in the activities of the Movement. One of the last activities she participated in was the Resistance Caravan for the Semi-arid Lula Livre.

January Marie Lapuz,26.0,2012-09-29,British Columbia,Canada,49.219593,-122.908372,violence,stabbed,"January was stabbed at around 10pm on Saturday 29th September. She died in hospital. A Vancouver support group for the transgender community is mourning the loss of one of their members after she was stabbed to death on Saturday.   Police identified the victim of New Westminster’s first homicide of the year Thursday as 26-year-old January Marie Lapuz, who legally changed her name from [deadname] in 2008. The stabbing death happened in the 500-block of 3rd Avenue at about 10 p.m. on Saturday and Lapuz died later in hospital. Police said an Asian man, around 5-5 tall, was seen running from the scene.January was the first transgender person to hold an executive position with Sher Vancouver, a support group for South Asian gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. Alex Sangha, Founder of Sher Vancouver, a support group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender South Asians said the community is shocked and saddened by her death. “She was very young and really a bright light and shining star,” Sangha said. “Everyone is very sad and very shocked. The way she died was very sad.” Sangha said Lapuz, who became social coordinator of Sher Vancouver in 2009, faced a lot of challenges as a transgender woman. “She had a lot of inner turmoil as a woman who was transgender and living in poverty with limited social support as an immigrant,” Sangha said. “We’re already very at risk in the community, a lot of people stigmatize [transgender people] and I just think it’s horrible – it’s a huge loss.” Despite these challenges, Sangha said she excelled as social coordinator of the group. “She was so natural with people, such great communication skills. She was the host of all our events, did fundraising… she was a great singer, she was a good public speaker,” Sangha said.In 2014 Charles Jameson ""Jamie"" Neel, 20, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to eight years in prison. He was paroled in June 2019 but recalled to prison in November 2019 after violating his parole conditions.In September 2018 the documentary [**""My Name Was ) was released.

She was treated in hospital and discharged, but died from complications two weeks later. Family and friends seek explanations for the death of Thabata Oliveira, 31, a [trans woman] who was stabbed on Afonso Pena, in the Center-South region of Belo Horizonte, in the early hours of January 21st. The victim was hospitalized and underwent medical care. However, she felt ill about two weeks after being discharged and died of complications from treatment. Now, the family's goal is to find out who stabbed Thabata. “We want answers, we want justice. She had a family too. We are feeling the loss very much. Thabata was a wonderful person, she never hurt anyone. Let's find out who did it,” said the [trans woman's] mother, Silvana Oliveira, 51.Thabatha had been lucky to survive the attack on 21st January, and it is absolutely tragic that she still lost her life despite being discharged from hospital. Even with a knife stuck in her back, Thabata managed to ask for help at a snack bar in the region, where the employees called the PM and Samu (Mobile Emergency Service). The victim told the police that a man was responsible for the attack, but did not identify the suspect. Thabata was taken to the João XXIII Hospital, where she was admitted and was discharged on 27 January. She was instructed to stay at rest and use medication. “She was doing well and respecting medical orders. We went to the doctor on February 6 and the doctor said that her lung was already fine. In fact, she was already going out with some friends. I even warned her that she should be careful,” says Silvana. On February 8, everything looked fine. but Thabata felt bad. “On Saturday, she left the house and said she would go around the corner. Before reaching the corner, Thabata came home calling for help. “She started vomiting blood and fell to the floor having a seizure. People were desperate and called Samu.

Dimitra Kalogiannis,64.0,2021-04-09,Attica,Greece,37.9303568,23.6838523,violence,run over,"Dimitra was killed in a hit and run incident on 9th April. Her body was not found until seven weeks later when the police were shamed into searching for her.The driver involved in the incident was subsequently arrested. The driver allegedly involved in the hit-and-run accident that killed a 64-year-old transgender woman who went missing from an Athens psychiatric hospital on April 6 has been arrested, according to Greek media.  News website in.gr said the suspect was identified by a fingerprint on Monday. Based on information attained by ANT1, the driver has admitted his action and is expected to appear before a prosecutor.  Kalogiannis was admitted to Athens’ Dromokaiteio Psychiatric Hospital on April 6 after being assaulted in her native Lesvos by a group of local teenagers who had hounded her on numerous prior occasions before forcing their way into her home, bullying her viciously and recording the incident on their mobile phones, then posting the footage on social media.  On April 9, she was killed in a hit-and-run in the area of Palaio Faliro, in southern Athens, and transferred to Tzanneio hospital. A DNA test that was only recently ordered by the authorities ascertained that the body found at the scene of the accident was that of Dimitra Kalogiannis, born Dimitris.  One of Dimitra’s brothers, Panagiotis, is expected to file charges over anyone responsible for the delay in launching a search of his sister.  Gerasimos Kourouklis, director of Silver Alert, has said that the service was informed of Kalogiannis’ disappearance by her brother and Dromokaitio, on April 6. He then immediately filed a report to declare her missing but the police did not proceed with the case because it viewed Kalogiannis as a “fugitive” from a psychiatric institution. Dimitra was killed in the car accident three days later and by the time the search was officially launched, she was already buried as a victim of unknown identity.Dimitra was extremely vulnerable and had been institutionalised as a teenager after coming out to her family. Dimitra Kalogiannis told her parents at the age of 14 that she was a girl. Her revelations were summarily dismissed and she was institutionalized.  Unknown to Dimitra, her family secertly began giving her psychotropic drugs which inhibited her functioning and thought processes. These drugs did her immeasurable harm since they were coupled with invasive and traumatic conversion regimens.  The Greek Reporter wrote that Kalogiannis was ping-ponged from chronic incarceration in clinics and years of being fed psychotropic medication to adjust the chemical makeup of her brain and nervous system. These medications were recommended to her family to treat her “mental illness” -declaring herself a female although she has the physical anatomy of a male. Fast forward 40 years and society has finally understood that gender identity and sexuality are not conditions to be fixed.  Dimitra took care her parents as they grew older on the small island of Lesvos just miles from the Turkish shore. It was becuse of that location and the influx of refugeess traveling through Turkey to Greece that we know of life and death. Her plight drew the attention of the international reporters who made two short films about her. This past December cinematographer Tzeli Hadjidimitriou uploaded a video of the interview she conducted with Kalogiannis in her home in Lesvos, titled “Mr. Dimitri and Mrs. Dimitroula.”  To get a full

Name Unknown,28.0,2020-01-16,Latium,Italy,41.62213,13.3249,uncategorised,not reported,"The victim was found dead in her apartment near Frosinone railway station. The cause of her death is not yet known. It is a mystery about the death of a 50-year-old [some reports say 30] transsexual woman of South American origin who was found dead at home in Frosinone. A neighbor called the police, suspicious after repeatedly knocking on the door. The agents, once inside, found the woman's body lying on the ground, lifeless. No signs of violence were found on the body. A tragic news that cannot exclude a priori the path of transphobia, as remarked by Francesco Angeli , president of Arcigay Rome. We learn in the press that a young trans girl has been found lifeless inside her apartment in Frosinone. It is important not to exclude in the investigations that it is a murder occurred due to transphobia. Italy in fact holds the sad record in Europe of murders due to transphobic hatred, and the many victims of recent years make us reflect on how much the theme of the security and isolation of trans people in our country is totally out of the interest of politics, which should represent everyone. Once again, moreover, some press reported the news narrating it in the male, as denounced on social media by Gianmarco Capogna. Still to ascertain many details of what happened, yet, the local press deemed it necessary immediately to focus on the victim's transsexual identity. An identity entirely narrated to men, ""a trans"", ""a young transsexual from Paraguay"". There are no certain details yet but if it were not an FtM (female to male) person, the entire narrative and the language used is completely wrong and disrespectful of the gender identity of the victim.

Merci Mack,22.0,2020-06-30,Texas,United States of America,32.6954731,-96.7718053,violence,shot,"Merci was found unconscious and with gunshot wounds in the parking lot of an apartment complex after neighbours had reported hearing gunfire. She died at the scene. Her name was Merci Mack. She was a 22-year-old Black trans woman living in Dallas. She had a job, a car, family, and friends. Her social media posts were playful, blunt, and hopeful. On Tuesday, the final day of Pride month, she was found dead from gunshot wounds in the parking lot of an apartment complex [at the 3000 block of East Ledbetter Drive]. It was 6:15 AM. Neighbors reported hearing gunfire around 5 AM. The final day of Pride month, in the midst of a nationwide uprising for racial justice, a young Black trans woman loses her life to gunfire. I remember yesterday, remember looking at the Google Doodle of Marsha P. Johnson, one of the most revered Black trans women in LGBTQIA history. And I weep thinking that 50+ years later, our trans neighbors particularly our trans BIPOC sisters are still bearing the brunt of the oppression. That we are grieving 22 year olds and 17 year olds. Merci is the 17th violent death of a transgender person in the US during 2020. Eight of those neighbors were 25 or younger, including Merci who was 22. Another young Texas trans woman was shot to death in early May. Like so many others, Merci has been deadnamed and misgendered by law enforcement and police. You might notice its ‘not as bad’ as it has been, but if she can’t have respect in these final days after enduring so much violence – when? “Merci was loved,” Shannon Walker, the founder of Nu Trans Movement, an advocacy group for trans people in Dallas, told Buzzfeed. “Her family loved her. Her dad, her mom, loved her unconditionally, and that is rare to see in the Black community when it comes to young Black trans folk.”On 10th July it was reported that a suspect had been arested. Angelo Walker, 20, was arrested by the North Texas Fugitive Task Force this week. An anonymous witness came forward and said they saw Walker chase Mack through the apartment complex lot and then stand over her and fire multiple shots, according to the arrest affidavit.Reportedly Walker had known her since childhood.Merci's  ",2020.0,Hutchins,1,"['merci', 'was', 'found', 'unconscious', 'and', 'with', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'in', 'the', 'parking', 'lot', 'of', 'an', 'apartment',

Valis Ortíz,39.0,2022-07-17,Mexico,Mexico,19.3910038,-99.2836989,suicide,suicide,"Valis was a musician and multi-disciplinary artist. She was found dead on Sunday 17th July. Mexican musician and multi-disciplinary artist Valiz Ortíz was found dead on Sunday, July 17. She was 39 years old. The news broke on Monday afternoon (July 18) after close friends began sharing condolences messages on social media in an outpour of grief that has highlighted two decades of the artist’s visionary, influential, and extensive body of work.  Hailing from Monterrey, Nuevo León, Ortíz became closely associated with the city’s experimental indie boom of the late 2000s that saw the rise of her band Bam Bam, as well as Selma Oxor, White Ninja, NRMAL, and underground venue El Garage. Ortíz was a prolific singer/songwriter,  and producer, an authority in Mexican psych music with detours into ambient and noise, and her work extended far beyond Bam Bam into projects like Ruidos en el Techo, Hypnomango, and XYX. In 2017, she relocated to Mexico City and launched Manitas Nerviosas, a new project melding her psychedelic visions with DIY electronic textures.  Valis Ortíz was a proud trans woman, and Manitas Nerviosas became a canvas for her ongoing metamorphosis. “Tu Carita Toda Hermosa” captured an existential shift for the artist where she shed the pseudonym “Mou,” by which fans and colleagues had known her for many years. She later legally changed her name to Valis (Vast Active Living Intelligence System), inspired by Philip K. Dick’s 1981 novel of the same name. She frequently collaborated with fellow trans artists such as Alda Arita, Luisa Almaguer, and Sofia Moreno; the latter a co-director on her music video for “Pármenux” from her buoyant final album A Love Supermeme. She was also an outspoken critic of TERFs (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists), a stance she immortalized with devilish gusto on “[Terfs R’   Beyond her own musical work, Ortíz was an active part of labels such as Nene Records and Oris Label.  She was also an architect and talented illustrator, releasing numerous zines and with much of her visual work still available on Tumblr. Humor, criticism, and raw honesty intersected across her work, making this an immeasurable loss for Mexican experimental music and underground art.Valis' Twitter and Instagram profiles are  and She

Niharika Narasimhamurthy,35.0,2021-03-20,Karnataka,India,14.11474095,76.97712746,violence,stabbed and burned,"Niharika was reportedly killed by two men who left her body by a roadway.  Transgender woman Niharika Narasimhamurthy was reportedly burned alive by two men Saturday morning and left by a roadway.  Niharika Narasimhamurthy’s body was found alongside the Hindupur-Sira Highway Saturday morning with her throat slit and half burnt.  The police say that they are looking for two suspects, Rajasekhar and Hanumanthappa. According to the police, Rajasekhar was the victim’s longtime friend and lover. They say he used to visit often until his wife became suspicious. To ally his wife’s fears he killed Niharika first slicing her throat then dousing her with gasoline to set her afire.  The Hindu, which first reported on this, predictably told a different story. The Hindu wrote that Niharika was a working girl who died trying to extort her client for money. According to that narrative, Rajasekhar refused to pay her so Niharika threatened to out him. This ‘put him a spot’ so he killed her.  That would be a lot to assume since the killers hadn’t been caught. But it isn’t unexpected as it fits a pattern well established by Indian media. India’s transgender people will never stand a chance of achieving the level of equality guaranteed by their constitution and courts until the press and police treat them respectfully.  Even if the police had relayed that story to them as the Hindu claims, Niharika Narasimhamurthy at a minimum deserves both dignity in death and a fair trial.  Rest in Peace Niharika Narasimhamurthy.

Sumana Dhar,32.0,2021-08-01,West Bengal,India,22.684557,88.42485253,violence,shot,"Sumana was shot outside her home.She was a local community leader and it is suspected that community rivalries may have been behind the killing. Bike-borne youths gunned down Sumana Dhar, a transgender person, when she was about to step into her house in Sabitri Pally in Nimta, about 16km north from the heart of Calcutta, on Sunday evening. Sumana was a prominent voice within the community, who would protest against alleged wrongdoings by some of the members in Birati, Nimta and adjoining areas. Some of those who knew the 32-year-old said Sumana used to attend meetings and conferences on transgender rights and tried to persuade several of the community members not to engage in infighting. In Nimta, Sumana organised small meetings to try and influence some of the community members to refrain from certain activities that create a wrong impression about transgender people in public minds, police said. “Sumana came across as a very upright individual who wanted to reform some members of the community across parts of North 24-Parganas,” said Ranjita Sinha, a transgender activist and former member of the West Bengal Transgender Welfare Board. “This murder sends out very disturbing signals for our community.” The police said four youths came riding motorcycles around 7pm and fired four bullets from close range, leaving Sumana in a pool of blood on the road leading to her house, which is located in an area under North Dum Dum Municipality.Two people were subsequently arrested.",2021.0,Madhyamgram,1,"['sumana', 'was', 'shot', 'outside', 'her', 'home', 'she', 'was', 'a', 'local', 'community', 'leader', 'and', 'it', 'is', 'suspected', 'that', 'community', 'rivalries', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'behind', 'the', 'killing', 'bike', 'borne', 'youths', 'gunned', 'down', 'sumana', 'dhar', 'a', 'transgender', 'person', 'when', 'she', 'was', 'about', 'to', 'step', 'into', 'her', 'house', 'in', 'sabitri', 'pally', 'in', 'nimta', 'about', '16km', 'north', 'from', 'the', 'heart', 'of', 'calcutta', 'on', 'sunday', 'evening', 'sumana', 'was', 'a', 'prominent', 'voice', 'within', 'the', 'community', 'who', 'would', 'protest', 'against', 'alleged', 'wrongdoings', 'by', 'some', 'of', 'the', 'members', 'in', 'birati', 'nimta', 'and', 'adjoining', 'areas', 'some', 'of', 'those', 'who', 'knew', 'the', '32', 'year', 'old', 'said', 'sumana', 'used', 'to', 'attend', 'meetings', 'and', 'conferences', 'on', 'transgender', 'rights', 'and', 'tried', 'to', 'persuade', 'several', 'of', 'the', 'community', 'members', 'not', 'to', 'engage', 'in', 'infighting', 'in', 'nimta', 'sumana', 'organised', 'small', 'meetings', 'to', 'try', 'and', 'influence', 'some', 'of', 'the', 'community', 'members', 'to', 'refrain', 'from', 'certain', 'activities', 'that', 'create', 'a', 'wrong', 'impression', 'about', 'transgender', 'people', 'in', 'public', 'minds', 'police', 'said', 'sumana', 'came', 'across', 'as', 'a', 'very', 'upright', 'individual', 'who', 'wanted', 'to', 'reform', 'some', 'members', 'of', 'the', 'community', 'across', 'parts', 'of', 'north', '24', 'parganas', 'said', 'ranjita', 'sinha', 'a', 'transgender', 'activist', 'and', 'former', 'member', 'of', 'the', 'west', 'bengal', 'transgender', 'welfare', 'board', 'this', 'murder', 'sends', 'out', 'very', 'disturbing', 'signals', 'for', 'our', 'community', 'the', 'police', 'said', 'four', 'youths', 'came', 'riding', 'motorcycles', 'around', '7pm', 'and', 'fired', 'four', 'bullets', 'from', 'close', 'range', 'leaving', 'sumana', 'in', 'a', 'pool', 'of', 'blood', 'on', 'the', 'road', 'leading', 'to', 'her', 'house', 'which', 'is', 'located', 'in', 'an', 'area', 'under', 'north', 'dum', 'dum', 'municipality', 'two', 'people', 'were', 'subsequently', 'arrested']",sumana wa shot outside her home she wa a local community leader and it is suspected that community rivalry may have been behind the killing bike borne youth gunned down sumana dhar a transgender person when she wa about to step into her house in sabitri pally in nimta about 16km north from the heart of calcutta on sunday evening sumana wa a prominent voice within the community who would protest against alleged wrongdoing by some of the member in birati nimta and adjoining area some of those who knew the 32 year old said sumana used to attend meeting and conference on transgender right and tried to persuade several of the community member not to engage in infighting in nimta sumana organised small meeting to try and influence some of the community member to refrain from certain activity that create a wrong impression about transgender people in public mind police said sumana came across a a very upright individual who wanted to reform some member of the community across part of north 24 parganas said ranjita sinha a transgender activist and former member of the west bengal transgender welfare board this murder sends out very disturbing signal for our community the police said four youth came riding motorcycle around 7pm and fired four bullet from close range leaving sumana in a pool of blood on the road leading to her house which is located in an area under north dum dum municipality two people were subsequently arrested

Her death is being treated as a homicide. The Biobío Regional Prosecutor's Office ordered the PDI Homicide Brigade to investigate the death of a trans woman in Concepción after being injected with chemical products for cosmetic purposes.  According to initial information, the death of the trans woman occurred inside her home. A man had traveled from the Metropolitan Region to the regional capital of Biobío to apply the silicone injection.  The prosecutor in charge, Jorge Lorca, pointed out that “ Carabineros reported that a 36-year-old person inside a home who had apparently undergone cosmetic [filler] injections but had felt ill in the afternoon. She did not go to any health care center and when SAMU arrived, this person died. We are investigating the substance involved.”  The Amanda Jofré Trans People's Union pointed out that the victim was a trans woman from Concepción who did not manage to legally process her gender change and had to resort to this type of illegal surgeries, since they are “Very expensive and difficult to access” by regular means.  “For trans women, part of having a healthy transition is also being able to perform aesthetic interventions in a safe and comprehensive way for our community. Part of feeling safe with who we are is feeling good about ourselves; with the mind, body and soul”, concluded the Amanda Jofré Trans People's Union. ""After what happened to the trans compañera Malu Mejías who died from the injection of industrial silicone in a clandestine clinic in Concepción, a comprehensive health plan for trans people is necessary""  For trans women, part of having a healthy transition is also being able to perform aesthetic interventions in a safe and comprehensive way for our community. Part of feeling safe with who we are is feeling good about ourselves; with mind, body and soul. Today surgeries, apart from being very expensive, are difficult for us to access.

She had also been robbed. Soledad Rojas Paúcar (48), also known as Shisha, was murdered on November 12 in her “Rojas” mini-market located in block 19 of Mariscal Castilla, in the district of El Tambo, Huancayo, Sierra del Peru. They found her inside her premises stabbed in the neck and nape.  According to initial investigations, there had been a previous meeting at the victim's premises. Shisha did not appear to have resisted the attack, so it is thought that the perpetrator might have been someone known to her. The murderer stole her savings of approximately 7 thousand sols. Neighbors point out that despite the fact that the location is close to the Municipality, there are no surveillance cameras on the streets that could help to find Shisha's killer.  Shisha was a hard worker who was integrated into her community and well-liked. She used to sell mazamorras and chicha at local fairs and participated in local festivities as a tunantera (a typical dance in the region). During the pandemic, she had rented her premises to sell groceries.Soledad is one of those remembered in [*""Resistiendo por  by *Proyecto Cancionar* (""The Song Project""): A group of feminist activists will join their voices in a collective song called ""Resistiendo por Justicia"", as a call for justice in the cases of gender violence that have taken place in the country.

Two died, including Gabi.The attack took place on R. das Crianças. The aggressor reportedly had had an amorous relationship with one of the victims. The police are looking for a 36-year-old man suspected of killing two people and stabbing two others in the Novo Paraíso II neighborhood in Cuiabá. According to information passed on to the lieutenant colonel of the Military Police, Gilberto Duarte Vitório, the suspect invaded the residence at dawn on Saturday (6) and struck several knife blows against the four people. The motive, according to the policeman, was a betrayal. ""He found out that his wife was cheating on him with another woman,"" he said.  Also according to the police, at the scene of the crime the suspect found his wife, her lover and two other people, one being a [trans woman]. One of the victims, 22, was stabbed in the chest and died on the spot. The police do not know whether the victim was the suspect's wife. The 21-year-old [trans woman], who was a friend of his lover, was hit with three stabs to the chest. He was rescued by an ambulance from the Mobile Emergency Service (Samu) and sent to the emergency department of the capital in serious condition.

Prior to detransitioning Marcelino had lived as a trans woman named Soledad. Soledad Fernández, 42, was murdered on Monday, October 7 at night behind Villa del Sol, a closed condominium on the way to the town of Zanja Pyta, a neighbor of Pedro Juan Caballero (Amambay). Soledad, trans who towards the end of his life asked to be renamed Marcelino Soler, was accompanied by Leonardo Miranda De Oliveira when a hooded cis man began to follow them. According to Miranda's later statements, the man told them it was an assault but immediately shot Soledad.Panambí activist Yren Rotela said the following about the victim: “I met Soledad in 2009 because I was a reference for Panambi in Pedro Juan Caballero at that time. That year she was doing a job with the population there. She was also a health promoter, I know she went through many things, ”said Yren and said that since she became involved in evangelism she began to change her gaze towards the collective.

Nataly Lily,23.0,2020-12-12,Sao Paulo,Brazil,-23.5489222,-46.262435,violence,shot,"Nataly and a colleague were both shot. Her colleague managed to escape, and although police found bloodstains at the crime scene and they were unable to locate Nataly's body. Nataly Lily's family and friends have been looking for her since Sunday night (13), when they learned that the woman, who is transsexual, could have been murdered. She was accompanied by a friend, who was shot and sent to the hospital Luzia de Pinho Melo, but was unable to say where the shooting took place.  ""My sister is an escort and does programs near a hotel in Jundiapeba. On Saturday, she went there and never came back. She was accompanied by a friend, who also does programs, and the two were invited by a couple, who paid in anticipation of a show"", said Luan Fortunato, the brother of the victim.  He explains that this friend said that Nataly was the one who talked to the couple initially and then invited her to participate. They got in the car and headed towards Avenida das Orquídeas. Customers reportedly said they were going to a party at a farm, but when they arrived, only Nataly got out of the car and was shot.  ""Her friend was still in the car and when she saw my sister she had already been shot. They had two other boys waiting in that place and they showed pictures, but they were not of my sister or of her friend. I believe that the attack was a mistake"", says Luan.  Even with the confusion, the friend was not spared being shot in the mouth and arm. After passing out, she woke up on top of Nataly and tried to wake her up, but thought she was already dead. The friend managed to run to a house in the Gica community, in the district of Braz Cubas. There, the Mobile Emergency Service (Samu) was called and she was referred to Luzia.  When she woke up in the hospital, the friend told her sister everything that happened and it was she who forwarded a voicemail to Luan telling what had happened. ""We already went looking for all the clues we had, we went close to Avenida das Orquídeas, in Parque Leon Feffer, but we didn't get anything. And the police aren't helping, they're not doing anything"", emphasizes the brother.  The São Paulo Public Security Secretariat (SSP) said only that the case was registered by the 2nd DP of Mogi das Cruzes as an attempted murder and disappearance of a person. They are investigating.On 21st December family members held a protest to call for justice. A group of family members and friends of the transsexual Nataly Lily, 23, who has been missing since the 12th , is holding a protest late Monday afternoon (21), in front of Motel Mogi (formerly Paraná), on Avenida Lourenço de Souza Franco, in Jundiapeba, access between Mogi das Cruzes and Suzano. The road was blocked in both directions by the protesters at around 6:20 pm, complicating traffic on the stretch, which is quite busy at this peak time.  A team from the Mogi Municipal Guard arrived at the place around 6:50 pm and soon received reinforcements, but the protesters - who ""seek justice for Nataly"" - refused to clear the avenue. Military Police (PM) and Urban Ostensive Round (Romu) officers were called - heavily armed - who talked to the participants. One driver broke through the blockade, running over one of the protesters, causing bruises to one of their legs. Other drivers chose to use alternative routes.  Participants in the protest carried placards asking for ""justice"" for Nataly and dressed white T-shirts.  At 7:10 pm the occurrence was accompanied by three police vehicles and seven from the Municipal Guard of Mogi. In dialogue with the Protestants, the teams released a banner in each direction. The crowd started to disperse around 7:30 pm. Participants walked the route peacefully. In February 2021 a court ordered that the alleged assailants Vanessa Silva Vieira, Danilo Nascimento Batista (known as ""Cocão""), Caio Cleiton Rodrigues Silva (known as branquinho) and Carlos Renato

Jessyca Sarmiento,38.0,2020-02-21,Ile-de-France,France,48.8618049,2.2448232,violence,run over,"Jessyca was deliberately run over in a hit and run attack.In August 2018 [Vanessa  had been killed nearby. A transgender [sex worker] from the Bois de Boulogne was crushed on the night of Thursday to Friday in Paris. Around 2:25 a.m. on allée de la reine Marguerite, a car with three suspects on board ran into the victim, who has not yet been formally identified. According to initial reports, the manoeuvre was deliberate. The emergency services were alerted by two witnesses. When briefly questioned, they said that a Renault Clio with no lights had driven at high speed towards the victim (who was on the road) and then driven away without stopping. The victim died at around 2:40 am in the hands of the emergency services and her body was taken to the medico-legal institute in Paris. Investigators from the first judicial police district are responsible for carrying out an investigation. The police discovered some debris from the killer car. At the end of the night, a Clio which could correspond to the description given by the witnesses was found abandoned in the XXth arrondissement of Paris.After Jessyca's murder Acceptess Transgenres released the following  **Death of Jessyca Sarmiento** **ACCEPTESS TRANSGENRES · FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2020** We are once again in the sadness of the discovery of the death of one of our own. On the night of February 20-21, Jessyca Sarmiento was killed at her workplace, knocked down by a car traveling at high speed in an alley in the Bois de Boulogne. The first elements of the investigation communicated by the press indicate that the car which struck it did not even stop. We are particularly dismayed by the possibility that this act was deliberate. An investigation has been opened and must shed light on the circumstances of this new tragedy. But it also calls for a response from the political class. Today, as it was two years ago after the assassination of Vanessa Campos, we are once again shocked by the death of one of our sisters, comrades, and colleagues. Our pain and suffering are indescribable. And our anger too. We know that we are going to have to fight against the enterprise of media trivialization already at work, in Le Parisien , whose first publication announced as usual the death of “a transvestite prostitute”, in a “high place of male prostitution”. Jessyca was a trans woman, sex worker, migrant, and she was killed at her workplace. We are dismayed to notice that the first reflex of the press is still, to stigmatize. In France, in 2020, it is still possible to think that assaulting trans people, assaulting sex workers are acts that can leave their perpetrators with a certain feeling of impunity, even pride, because they leave to their spectators a feeling of indifference, even of approval. We immerse ourselves in horror, in sadness, and in the constantly renewed bitter observation that our lives are worth so much less than those of others. Jessyca was a trans Peruvian woman, who came to France last year and, like all of us, aspired to a better life in this country. She had been followed for the first time by an abolitionist prostitution association, which had failed to ensure her care. She then turned to Acceptess-T. She benefited in our association from social, legal, health and administrative support, but she also found there a place of refuge and mutual aid, emotional and human support. Last month, she had started to participate in our French lessons, she was studious, applied, and generous, bringing to each session the meal for her comrades. She was “the driving force behind the group,” according to her teacher. She was preparing for the association's monthly celebration, scheduled for February 28. She had come to France to work and live there. She worked there and lived there for a year. And we cannot bear the idea that she died there for these reasons. We are already in contact with her family in Peru, and we are making the necessary arrangements so that they can come quickly to Paris. We are organizing a vigil this evening at 11 p.m. at the Bois de Boulogne. We call on our loved ones, our comrades, our colleagues and all those who can and who think that our lives deserve so much better, to join us at this gathering.

The killer fired as a train passed so as not to be heard.Two days later the police arrested two people at a bus stop in Ghaziabad. Uttar Pradesh Police on Monday claimed to have solved the murder case of transgender Daya Rani Kinnar with the arrest of two accused.  After investigation, Waris and Nadim were arrested from old Ghaziabad bus stand around 5.30 pm, Circle officer City 1st, Anil Kumar Yadav said, adding that their accomplice Sameer is still at large.  A country-made pistol, which was allegedly used to shoot her, and a knife have been recovered from their possession, he said.  During interrogation, the duo confessed that they murdered Daya Rani to usurp her wealth.  Also, Waris held a grudge against Daya after he got married to her niece Geeta, much against her (Daya's) wish. Later, Daya she let Geeta and her child stay at her house but did not allow Waris, he said.Daya had always lived in Dasna, Ghaziabad. She lived with other trans women in a shared bungalow.  Although illiterate, in 2004, 2009 and 2014 Daya Rani contested the Ghaziabad Lok Sabha constituency in the General Election as an independent. In 2007 she ran for the Uttar Pradesh assembly. She stressed her gender identity:   ""Why are people with me? Because other politicians fill their homes and cupboards. And I have no children, husband, wife or heirs. Whatever family I have is these people and I live off these people and I will fight for these people with the politicians who have not delivered on their promises.""

Estrella,28.0,2021-11-28,Antioquia,Colombia,7.0733132,-74.7033832,violence,shot,"Estrella was shot in her home after an argument. A transgender woman was killed Sunday night in the municipality of Segovia, northeast of Antioquia.  The 28-year-old, identified as Estrella, was at her home when men arrived and shot her several times.  After hearing this case, the Trans Community Network regretted the fact, again demanding guarantees for the LGBTI community in the country.  “The murders of trans women do not stop in Colombia. Nine days ago we were burying Antonella Alexandra in Arauca and yesterday Estrella was murdered in the municipality of Segovia. Several men came to her house and murdered her. It seems that our lives are not worth it, ""they said on their Twitter account.  The crime occurred in the Galán neighborhood, an urban area of Segovia, according to the Antioquia Police report.A suspect was subsequently arrested. A subject named with the alias of 'Walter' was sent to jail after being accused of the murder of 'Estrella', a well-known inhabitant of Segovia, Antioquia.

Karly Sasha Chinina Palomino,33.0,2020-03-05,Buenos Aires,Argentina,-34.6397659,-58.5372983,violence,shot,"Karly was shot in the street in the early hours of Thursday, 5th March. According to the advocacy organisation La Rosa Naranja she was killed by an extortion gang. Karly Sasha Chinina Palomino, a 33-year-old young trans woman, was killed at dawn on March 5 in Ciudadela, province of Buenos Aires. She was a native of Peru, lived in the City of Buenos Aires and survived by offering sexual services, like many people in the  group affected by structural violence.  The San Martín Prosecutor's Office number 5 intervened at the crime scene after the 911 call. Karly's body lay on Avenida Rivadavia and Granaderos, where the avenue runs parallel to the train tracks and there is a level crossing. The results of the autopsy were not yet known but it is known that she was shot. It is estimated that Karly was murdered between 1 and 2 am on Thursday, March 5, sources from the prosecution reported to Presentes. Some people said they got to see two men running away in the area of the tracks. Police personnel from the Ciudadela Sur police station intervened in the case. At the time of the incident, the victim carried no documentation so experts were ordered to take fingerprints. However her colleagues said without hesitation that she was Chinina. The organization La Rosa Naranja [""Orange Rose Civil Association""] released the news through a statement published yesterday on Facebook: “The companion known as Chinina was at the Ciudadela stop with other companions in prostitution, where she was intercepted by a group of criminals, gangsters, square collectors who got out of a car with a firearm and gave 3 shots directly towards our companion, leaving her lying on the ground and lifeless, then escaped. The Trans-Transvestite community is in great pain, sadness, furious because they keep killing us! We ask and demand that all authorities investigate, that Justice be done for Chinina, and that their transvestite not be unpunished.” Marcela Tobaldi, president of La Rosa Naranja says that Karly's murder is linked “to the mafias of human trafficking suffered by the trans and transvestite collective. They are mafias that force us to the narcotics market and force us to pay places when it shouldn't be. In this case, this girl always refused to pay and ended up with a bullet in the chest.Karly's ",2020.0,San Justo,1,"['karly', 'was', 'shot', 'in', 'the', 'street', 'in', 'the', 'early', 'hours', 'of',

The perpetrator (who had previously tried to kill his own mother) confessed to her murder. The death of a 13-year-old teenager, who was known as Keron Ravach, shocked the city of Camocim, 457 km from Fortaleza. The student was beaten to death, hit with blows and punches. Friends report that Keron was shy, but had the dream of being known and becoming a digital influencer. She was going through a gender transition process.  Keron was killed at dawn on Monday, April 4. The main suspect, a 17-year-old teenager, was apprehended. According to the head of the Camocim Police Station, Chief Herbert Ponte, the boy confessed to the crime and says he met the victim to do a sexual program. However, there was a disagreement over the payment of the amounts and he killed the girl. He attacked by stabbing, beating, punching and kicking her.  According to the police chief, the teenager, who was apprehended 21 hours after the crime, is violent - and according to reports heard by the Civil Police, he had already tried to kill his own mother. With the elucidation of the case, the suspect was interned by the Justice. The crime, according to Herbert Ponte, touched the city. ""He killed the child with a knife, while stoned. A barbaric crime,"" he says.  The educational institution where Keron studied, Escola de Ensino Fundamental Francisco Ottoni Coelho, issued a note of regret. ""In this moment of pain and indignation, the entire school community is in solidarity with family, friends, colleagues and expresses the most sincere condolences"", says the statement.Keron died just over three weeks before her 14th birthday. The victim would have been 14 on the 28th of this month. Her routine, according to her friends, was to study and play stamps every week in the town square. Most of the classmates who played with her were from the LGBTQ community and, after the games, they all went for a swim. The teenager was raised by a family member and had approximately 10 siblings, but who lived with different families. Keron's mother died a year ago, as O POVO found out with a victim's colleague, of cerebral aneurysm.   Her friend Ray Fontenelle says that Keron was shy, but she let go when she was among her colleagues. ""Humble and full of dreams. She was loved by everyone and loved to dance. She wanted to be known, digital influencer, make videos dancing. She was very helpful,"" she said. Ray says he doesn't believe the 17-year-old's claim of buying sex from the victim. ""I didn't believe in anything about her offering money for sex. She was very humble,"" he says.On 21st January a judge ruled that her killer was guilty of the equivalent of triple qualified homicide and should be hospitalised

Rest in power, little one. The Shinnecock Indian Nation came together on Monday night to mourn the death of one of their youngest members, 16-month-old Roy Antonio Jones III.  Nearly 100 tribe members shed tears and honored the life of the toddler, who died Sunday evening of cardiac arrest after authorities said he was beaten by his mother’s boyfriend at her home on the Shinnecock Indian Reservation.  The candlelight prayer vigil was held hours after 20-year-old Pedro Jones of Southampton, who is not a member of the Shinnecock Indian Nation, pleaded not guilty to first-degree manslaughter in Southampton Town Justice Court in connection with the toddler’s death. If convicted of the Class B violent felony, he faces five to 25 years in prison, according to the Suffolk County district attorney’s office.  According to a felony complaint filed with the Town Justice Court on Monday, August 2, police said that Mr. Jones caused the child’s death by “striking him several times throughout his body with his closed fists and grabbing him by the neck.”  Also, according to court documents of a police interview, Mr. Jones reportedly spoke with his parents from Southampton Hospital, where Roy was pronounced dead, and told them that he “killed Vanessa’s son and that he punched him too hard.” According to his comments in the documents, Mr. Jones said he was “trying to make him act like a boy instead of a

Nikki Kuhnhausen,17.0,2019-12-07,California,United States of America,40.657234,-121.465058,violence,murdered,"Nikki was killed by David Bogdanov after he discovered that she was transgender while they were on a date on 6th June. Her skeletal remains were found on 7th December. VANCOUVER, Wash. (KATU) – Police arrested a 25-year-old accused of murdering a transgender teenager who has been missing since June. Investigators said they believe 18-year-old Nikki Kuhnhausen was killed after revealing to the suspect, David Bogdanov, that she was [assigned male at birth]. On December 7, someone found Nikki's remains while collecting bear grass on Larch Mountain in a remote part of northeast Clark County. Detectives say Bogdanov had allegedly been talking with Kuhnhausen on Snapchat and planned to meet on June 6, when she was last seen alive. Authorities say cell phone records for that day show Bogdanov's cell phone was in the same remote area where her body was found. “We suspect that there was probably some interaction where - and by his own admission - that he determined that, somehow found out during conversation that she was transgender and he stated that he - that was offensive to his culture and he asked her to get out of his van,” said Lieutenant Tom Ryan of the Vancouver Police Dept. Major Crimes Unit. During an interview with detectives, Bogdonov said he and Nikki had been together in early June, they ""had a conflict"" and he asked Nikki to get out of his van. Bogdonov told them that Nikki walked away and he never saw her after that.Nikki was from Vancouver in nearby Washington State. She was 17 at the time she disappeared, but by the time her body was found she would have been 18. The date she died has not been confirmed, but cell phone records on the day of her disappearance put her alleged killer in the area where her body was later found.David Bogdanov, 25, was arrested on suspicion of murder.  Investigators said they believe Bogdanov met Kuhnhausen the morning she disappeared, killed her, and may have driven his white van - or one like it - up to Larch Mountain. ""The cause of death is always found by the medical examiner's office. There was some evidence that indicates at least the potential of some strangulation involved,"" Lt. Ryan said. Bogdanov is expected to make his first appearance on second-degree murder charges Wednesday morning at the Clark County courthouse.On 27th August 2021 Bogdanov was convicted of second degree murder and malicious harassment. Two weeks later on 9th September he was sentenced to 20 years in jail. A jury in Washington state found David Bogdanov, 27, guilty on Friday of killing transgender 17-year-old Nikki Kuhnhausen in 2019. The pair had connected on Snapchat before meeting up but Bogdanov flew into a rage after discovering she was transgender during a sexual encounter in the back of his car. He strangled her with the cord of a cellphone charger; her body was discovered six months later in forestland. Bogdanov claimed he acted in self-defense because Kuhnhausen reached for his gun during a struggle, but the jury didn’t buy his version of events. Kuhnhausen’s death led to the passage of the Nikki Kuhnhausen Act in Washington, which outlaws use of the so-called “panic defense” in LGBTQ+ homicides. Bogdanov was convicted of second-degree murder and malicious harassment, which is a hate crime in Washington.Nikki's ",2019.0,Burney,1,"['nikki', 'was', 'killed', 'by', 'david', 'bogdanov', 'after',

They further called for basic social support for asylum seekers, ""from which one can live and is not forced into the underground economy or sex work"".

She died in hospital.Her phone and purse were missing, and witnesses reported seeing a man leaving the area on foot. Kandis Capri, also known as [deadname], was shot multiple times on Aug. 11 and her body was found in a parking lot at La Reserve Apartments at 2627 N. 45th Ave. A suspect was seen leaving the area on foot, police said.  Capri was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), Kandis Capri, 35, was one of 16 transgender people to be murdered in the US this year.  “The only thing I know [for sure] is that my [daughter] was murdered,” Andria Gaines, Capri’s mother, told the Guardian. “[Kandis] was shot and I don’t know all the circumstances.”  Gaines continued: “[Capri] was at a lady’s apartment who [she] had been staying with for a couple of weeks. And the only thing I know is that the car [she] had rented had been towed or something, or suspected of being towed away, so [she] left her apartment and was shot.”A vigil was held for her on 19th August.

After community pressure Toronto police finally used DNA analysis to identify the body on 30th November.The results confirmed that the remains belonged to Alloura Wells, but her cause of death was ruled “undetermined.” Rebecca Price was walking through the Rosedale ravine in mid-town Toronto with a friend on Aug 5, 2017, when she came across a horrific sight: a dead woman’s body.  She called the police and followed up with the detective. Price spoke to the detective a few times, but he didn’t seem to know much. “I think he just couldn’t wait to get me off the phone,” she said. She did learn one crucial detail: the body was a transgender woman.  So Price went online and looked for organizations that did advocacy for transgender people, figuring they might be able to help find out who the woman was.

She died in hospital.She was a young trans woman who had a degree in Spanish from the University of Algiers, but after being abandoned by her family she had no choice but to earn a living as a sex worker. I received the news today from a friend of mine, an Algerian LGBT activist, who is now Belgium after he escaped for asylum. A brutal murder took the life of a young transsexual woman. She had a degree in Spanish from the University of Algiers. Her family threw her out on the street and, on the street, she could only find work as a sex worker to support herself. She lived in Algiers and went out every night to corners and streets frequented by sex workers and their customers. One night, four weeks ago, she was attacked by a group of strangers who beat her up severely. In the hospital, she arrived badly injured and died shortly after. She is one of many other transsexuals who fight for their lives constantly, day in and day out, in the Arab world. I hear of many transsexuals who die every year in Algeria. This one was reported to my friend by someone who works in the national HIV prevention program. How many others go unreported? The authorities are indifferent in the face of discrimination, and all of us who are silent are accomplices in these murders. Rest in peace, little sister, and if God exists, let him know I am outraged at this injustice.

Jayden Lowe,18.0,2018-09-22,England,United Kingdom (Great Britain),52.1102969,0.0254733,suicide,suicide,"Jayden died by suicide. He was on a waiting list for an NHS Gender Identity Clinic and was struggling with the delays involved. A transgender Cambridgeshire teenager took his own life after delays accessing gender affirming treatment on the NHS, a coroner's court heard today (March 29).  Jayden Lowe's death on September 22, 2018, followed the recent breakdown of a relationship he kept hidden from his parents.  The aspiring art student, of Meldreth, was born [deadname], but told doctors when he was 16 he knew from an early age he was a boy and changed his name by deed poll at the age of 17. Despite support offered by his local GP, an inquest heard how he struggled to get help to transition on the NHS and resorted to buying hormone replacement treatment online.  His mother Claire Lowe said her son had told to her about a month before his death, he had to be referred to an adult clinic because he was turning 18.  This meant an additional two-year wait for treatment, the coroner's court heard.  Mother Claire said Jayden told her: ""I can't carry on living like this.""  She said: ""That's why we allowed him to go online to seek his solution. We backed him because he was desperate. He was just living for the day he would just be a proper boy"". She also recalled how Jayden told her: ""You don't deserve a trans kid, it's not fair,"" and she had reassured him: ""We don't want another kid.""  She said: ""He thought it was unreasonable he had to live half girl, half boy. Since he started taking the testosterone we thought that things were looking up but that was maybe too little, too late.""  In a statement, a specialist in gender reassignment, who Jayden had a consultation with, noted the one transition clinic in London's Tavistock Square had ""extensive waiting lists, not in accordance with the NHS constitution"". He said Jayden had been on a child and adolescent waiting list for 11 months but because he was turning 18 was not eligible and would have to wait an additional two years to be seen in an adult clinic. In a statement Jayden's father Neil Lowe, recalled how his son had good grades in all his studies, was doing A-Levels, and wanted to go on to study History of Art at Oxford University. He said from an early age Jayden wanted to be known as 'Jess' and the family were aware he was transgender. However, long waiting lists for NHS reassignment treatment had forced the teen to ""give up"" and order male hormone treatment online. He said: ""Jayden has started taking these very recently before his death.""Jayden's death was not recorded on the official TDoR 2018 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU).",2018.0,Meldreth,0,"['jayden', 'died', 'by', 'suicide', 'he', 'was', 'on', 'a', 'waiting', 'list', 'for', 'an', 'nhs', 'gender', 'identity', 'clinic', 'and', 'was', 'struggling', 'with',

"Alejandra Benitez (""La Power"")",34.0,2020-11-05,Tucuman,Argentina,-26.84233,-65.2144797,violence,shot,"Alejandra was shot outside her home by an assailant on a motorcycle. Yesterday another transfemicide was known in Tucumán: Alejandra Benítez, a 34-year-old trans woman, was shot dead in the back on the sidewalk where she lived, on Avenida Roca and Ayacucho in the provincial capital. During the morning, the Homicide Prosecutor Unit No. 2 reported that a key witness had been testified. Witness accounts point to a man as the person responsible for the shooting.  ""The last we knew is that a guy got off the motorcycle, argued with her and shot her point blank,"" said Claudinna Rukone, a trans activist and friend of Alejandra. ""Apparently Alejandra was walking away when this person drew the weapon,"" says Lorenzo Franco, coordinator in Tucumán of the Association of Transsexual and Transgender Transvestites of Argentina (ATTTA).  The organization were with Alejandra's family on Wednesday. “I met Alejandra during the pandemic. She carried the needs of her companions on her shoulders and worked a lot with food parcels so that those who were having a very bad time did not lack, ”says Franco.  That of Alejandra Benítez is the second transfemicide in the province since the measures for the Covid 19 pandemic began . The previous one was that of [Vanesa  a 20-year-old girl whose body was found in the Canal Sur area in San Miguel de Tucumán. Alejandra and Vanesa earned their daily living as sex workers, as did so many [trans women] who suffer structural violence and lack of access to basic rights. Neither of them reached the average age of life of a trans person in Latin America: 35 years.Alejandra was one of the founders of [Trans  had a reputation for being cheerful and was well loved in her community. Alejandra Benítez was also Alejandra Power or, simply, La Power, as she was known around here. Among the younger trans women, they called her Godmother or Mother because she was the one who accompanied and advised them in the transgender transition process. “ In the neighborhood, the girls called her mom. She was a spokesperson and godmother for the younger trans. She cared for them and protected them. They were very companions of hers and now they are all destroyed, ”says Federico. Alejandra was a sex worker and one of the creators of the group Trans Unidas whose objective is to make visible all the demands and needs of the community of trans women in the province. During the pandemic, Alejandra helped collect merchandise for trans women from Tucumán.  “She had no problem with anyone, she shared with anyone, as long as they don't disrespect her. She has always been about improving herself, about traveling. She was in solidarity with everyone here, she never forgot that she comes from a humble neighborhood. The whole neighborhood is shocked by what has happened and we feel unprotected by the state. Politicians and judges leave much to be desired, those who represent us are killing us”, reflects Federico. In June 2021 Ricardo Puenzo was acquitted through lack of evidence. The trial for the transfemicide of Alejandra Estefanía La Power Benítez has concluded after a week of deliberations. Unanimously, the court comprised of Judge María Balcazar (president), Judge Rafael Marorito and Judge Isabel Menéndez, acquitted Ricardo Puenzo, the only accused of the crime. In their summing up, they pointed to the Public Prosecutor's Office, under the charge of prosecutor Carlos Sale, for deficiencies in the investigation that did not manage to gather enough evidence to determine with certainty that Puenzo was responsible for the six shots that killed the young trans woman or the four who injured Diego Mercado. “Unfortunately, due to the way in which this case was investigated, it is not possible to reach full certainty and conviction that Ricardo“ Ricky ”Puenzo was the author of the shots that caused the death of Alejandra Estefanía Benítez and injured Diego Ramos Mercado”, read Judge Menéndez in the public hearing followed by more than 100 people who were waiting attentively for the verdict. Mercado was a key witness of the trial and on whom the prosecution had relied for evidence to locate Puenzo, not only at the scene of the event, but as the material author of the crime, since he had affirmed this in the statements he gave to the prosecution. However, during the trial his testimony changed and he then maintained that when he was shot he was facing away and could not be sure who had fired. As a result, the court gave rise to the prosecution's request for Mercado to be investigated for false testimony. The magistrates launched strong criticism of the investigation of the incident, blaming the homicide prosecutor, Sale, and the police for having followed only one line of investigation and for having ruled out other lines of investigation, such as Benítez's ex-partner, for being a gender crime.",2020.0,San Miguel de Tucuman,1,"['alejandra', 'was', 'shot', 'outside', 'her', 'home', 'by', 'an',

a key witness of the trial and on whom the prosecution had relied for evidence to locate puenzo not only at the scene of the event but a the material author of the crime since he had affirmed this in the statement he gave to the prosecution however during the trial his testimony changed and he then maintained that when he wa shot he wa facing away and could not be sure who had fired a a result the

Emma Boland,15.0,2022-01-17,England,United Kingdom (Great Britain),51.7260098,-1.5879024,suicide,suicide,"Emma died by suicide. A teenager took her own life after being told of an Instagram post that had circulated around her Oxfordshire school, an inquest heard. Emma Boland, 15, was said to have been caused ‘great upset’ by the social media post on January 17, the precise nature of which was not set out by senior coroner Darren Salter this afternoon.  A fellow pupil described the girl, who was born Christopher Boland and was in the process of transitioning from male to female, holding her ‘head in her hands’ and saying the Instagram post had been ‘misunderstood’.  Oxford Coroner’s Court heard the teenager returned home to the house she shared with her parents and brother in Bampton at around 3.20pm then left to see a friend about 10 minutes later.  When their daughter had not returned by 6.30pm, her parents tried to contact her and her friends. Her mother, Rachel, ‘found out something had happened at school that day and it was concerning social media’, the inquest heard. She rang the police and reported Emma missing. Her father, Stuart, discovered his daughter by Shill Brook, around a 20 minute walk from her home. A post-mortem gave the cause of the girl’s death as hanging.  In a statement summarised by the coroner, Mr Boland said Emma had previously struggled with poor mental health. Shortly before Christmas 2021, a few weeks before her death, she decided she wanted to be known as Emma and began the process of transitioning from male to female. “Everyone was very supportive,” her father said. The girl was reportedly a high-achieving student.  The family spent the weekend before her death on Monday, January 17, ‘watching films and building Lego’ together. Her father said: “Emma seemed really happy.”  Emma did not have her phone with her at school on the Monday. However, she was said to have become aware of the Instagram post circulating among pupils at her school during the day. The post, which did not name anyone directly, was said by Mr Salter to have ‘included details of a past personal relationship that Emma had with a girl of the same age previously’.  One fellow pupil, a 15-year-old boy said Emma told them the post had been ‘misunderstood’ and had her ‘head in her hands’. Another said Emma had asked if she could see the post and said ‘there were some things true, others not’. She was ‘very down in the dumps about it’, he added.  The post was reported to Joe Winter, deputy headteacher at Faringdon Community College, on January 17 by the Year 11 lead, who had been approached by a pupil. Mr Winter was said to have decided that an investigation into the post would continue the following day. The school was informed shortly before 8pm that Emma had been reported missing.  Recording a conclusion of suicide, Mr Salter said it appeared Emma had intended to take her own life but that it had happened ‘in the context of…what appears to be great upset and that, of course, is very, very regrettable indeed’.",2022.0,Carterton,0,"['emma', 'died', 'by', 'suicide', 'a', 'teenager', 'took', 'her', 'own', 'life', 'after', 'being', 'told', 'of', 'an', 'instagram', 'post', 'that',

While searching the area, they discovered a woman’s body near the railroad tracks just west of [1313] Cove Avenue.  No other details about the incident were made available.Eliana Turan, Director Of Development at The LGBT Community Center of Greater Cleveland said: ""Transgender woman Rukia Isis Bemer died around the same time as Lea. The authorities found her body on railroad tracks in the inner Cleveland suburb of Lakewood, very near where I live. She was only 22.  We still do not know if she died of suicide, or if it was an accident or foul play. Most of the media coverage focused on Lea’s death [[Lea Rayshon  who died the same day in Cleveland], so we don’t know very much about Rukia’s passing.""According to the police report, video recorded from the train shows her walking eastbound towards the westbound train - with her head up and wearing earphones. The train blew its whistle continuously before hitting her.Rukia's obituary describes her as ""a lifelong resident of Lakewood and a pioneer to the LGBTQ community there.

Victoria Alejandra Ironici,43.0,2022-08-21,Santa Fe,Argentina,-31.5826867,-60.7425532,violence,stabbed and burned,"Alejandra was killed in her home, allegedly by her partner. The Prosecutor's Office is investigating her death as transfemicide. SANTA FE CITY, Santa Fe. The Santa Fe trans figure, Alejandra Ironici, was murdered in her home – Public Passage 8133 -, in the northwest of the city. She was 43 years old and was the coordinator of the Movement for Social, Ethnic and Religious Integration (MISER) Santa Fe. Alejandra was the promoter of important advances in human rights for the trans community and was the first to receive her DNI with the registration change, as well as to access a teaching position in the State of Santa Fe, among other actions.  This Sunday, August 21, around 11 pm, Alejandra's nephew - who lives in the same house - returned from work, and when he entered there was a fire in the bedroom. Upon entering, according to what he stated to the Police, he found his aunt with signs of burns and in a pool of blood. He immediately called 911. When the police arrived at the scene, they confirmed that the victim was already dead. They began the operation to preserve the scene of the incident and asked for experts and a health unit to attend (which never arrived).  After a check of the house, the young man alerted the Police that his aunt's car, a GRAY FIAT PALIO, was not in the garage. Alejandra's current partner, with whom she had had a relationship for about five months, was also missing. This morning, they found Alejandra's car in Padre Dusso at 7200 in the city of Santa Fe. A person was also arrested at the same location. The detainee is a 32-year-old man, whose initials are DHB and was Alejandra's current partner, and the arrest occurred in a house in front of which the victim's car was found.  The case is being investigated by the Santa Fe Femicide Brigade, in charge of the prosecutor Alejandra Del Río Ayala. In the next few hours, he will request the Office of Judicial Management to set the day and time for the impeachment hearing of the detainee.  In March 2018, after two transfemicides perpetrated in the capital of Santa Fe and the area - that of Adriana Cuqui Bonetto and that of Sol - it was Alejadra Ironici who explained to Presentes: ""Most trans women in the city and its surroundings live alone and in peripheral areas, which deepens their situation of vulnerability.”  Victoria Alejandra Ironici had many titles. Her life was one of struggle and, above all, achievement. She was the first trans woman to get a DNI that respects her identity, even before the law guaranteed that right for everyone. If all the actions in which she was a pioneer began to be enumerated, the list would include all the claims achieved by the Santa Fe transvestite collective.  Her story of struggle begins at the age of 18, when she was kicked out of her house for being trans. She came from Vera to Santa Fe capital to find more opportunities. In 2007, after losing a job, she began the administrative process for the province of Santa Fe to recognize her identity. In 2010, two months before the Gender Identity Law was sanctioned, a ceremony was held at Government House. The then Governor Antonio Bonfatti gave her her corrected birth certificate and DNI. Last year, Alejandra and Lucy Gimenez became the first trans teachers to agree to substitute classes in secondary schools in the city. “It is the fundamental door of what we have been fighting for: the educational system had to be with us. In that process we had been working with Lucy to break that social prejudice. Today we have to do it from within the schools, already as teachers, ”she said on that occasion.Alejandra was a teacher, activist and a pioneer among the Santa Fe LGBT+ community.

Without having to hide, because I did not commit any crime. All I did was choose a different life. That meant that I was denied a lot of rights , ”she said that day when she began to be Victoria Alejandra Ironici. ""I wanted Selenia as a third name but she will have to stay as my stage name,"" she joked.  That day she also told his next goals: to get a job and have a vaginoplasty. She met both goals and continued to break new ground. In 2013, she was the first trans woman to undergo the surgical procedure through the social work of the province and in a hospital in Buenos Aires.  Alejandra was a great promoter of the trans quota at different levels of the State and national organizations. She was studying law at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral , and she was one of the promoters of the quota in that house of higher studies.   On May 31, in an [interview with  for a report on the quota in Argentine universities, she said: “On a social and cultural level, it positions us differently. Society is going to see that we want to go for more acceptance and inclusion and that the UNL gives its support, through a resolution that is the product of our project and of the national law”. That path had already been traveled with the struggle in the province and in the provincial capital.

She opened paths for her and for those who come after her. Every day of her life de ella was a struggle to break the 40-year life expectancy that the group has.

Ariana Esquivel,24.0,2018-10-21,Buenos Aires,Argentina,-34.7725,-58.65108,suicide,suicide,"Ariana died by suicide. She was a police officer and was suffering discrimination at work. The incident occurred last night, around 9:00 pm, when the officer and two other officers were on board a patrol car carrying out their duties.  According to the police report, at around 8:15 pm, they stopped to buy food at the San Justo Shopping Mall after which they resumed their tour. While they were traveling through Zapiola in the direction of Peribebuy to Route 3, they noticed that Esquivel had a cell phone on which she was receiving messages.  Minutes later, the witnesses said they heard an ""unexpected explosion"" and stopped the car thinking that a tyre had burst, but when they got out they noticed that their partner was injured in the back of the car. Meanwhile, her regulation weapon, a 9 mm pistol, was lying on the floor.  The officer was immediately rushed to the Solís Clinic in the aforementioned town, where medical attention was given, but unfortunately she died. **Suicide of the trans police officer: ""Ariana suffered a lot of discrimination in her work""**  A friend of the officer who committed suicide last night inside a patrol car told that she had been suffering from a great depression because five months ago she had decided to show herself according to his self-perceived gender. The rejection she received would have led her to make that decision.  Ariana was 24 years old and had worked in the security forces for six years. In the last five months she had decided to show herself as she was and began her transformation, but that, according to her friends, led her to face the rejection of many people.  ""She was not having a good time. She suffered a lot of discrimination at work, she was not well with her family, they were very closed and it was difficult for them to accept her as she was. That led her to feel like she was always wrong, "" one of her friends told SN Online.",2018.0,Pontevedra,0,"['ariana', 'died', 'by', 'suicide', 'she', 'was', 'a', 'police', 'officer', 'and', 'was', 'suffering', 'discrimination', 'at', 'work', 'the', 'incident', 'occurred', 'last', 'night', 'around', '9', '00', 'pm', 'when', 'the', 'officer', 'and', 'two', 'other', 'officers', 'were', 'on', 'board', 'a', 'patrol', 'car', 'carrying', 'out', 'their', 'duties', 'according', 'to', 'the', 'police', 'report', 'at', 'around', '8', '15', 'pm', 'they', 'stopped', 'to', 'buy', 'food', 'at', 'the', 'san', 'justo', 'shopping', 'mall', 'after', 'which', 'they', 'resumed', 'their', 'tour', 'while', 'they', 'were', 'traveling', 'through', 'zapiola', 'in', 'the', 'direction', 'of', 'peribebuy', 'to', 'route', '3', 'they', 'noticed', 'that', 'esquivel', 'had', 'a', 'cell', 'phone', 'on', 'which', 'she', 'was', 'receiving', 'messages', 'minutes', 'later', 'the', 'witnesses', 'said', 'they', 'heard', 'an', 'unexpected', 'explosion', 'and', 'stopped', 'the', 'car', 'thinking', 'that', 'a', 'tyre', 'had', 'burst', 'but', 'when', 'they', 'got', 'out', 'they', 'noticed', 'that', 'their', 'partner', 'was', 'injured', 'in', 'the', 'back', 'of', 'the', 'car', 'meanwhile', 'her', 'regulation', 'weapon', 'a', '9', 'mm', 'pistol', 'was', 'lying', 'on', 'the', 'floor', 'the', 'officer', 'was', 'immediately', 'rushed', 'to', 'the', 'solís', 'clinic', 'in', 'the', 'aforementioned', 'town', 'where', 'medical', 'attention', 'was', 'given', 'but', 'unfortunately', 'she', 'died', 'suicide', 'of', 'the', 'trans', 'police', 'officer', 'ariana', 'suffered', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'discrimination', 'in', 'her', 'work', 'a', 'friend', 'of', 'the', 'officer', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'last', 'night', 'inside', 'a', 'patrol', 'car', 'told', 'that', 'she', 'had', 'been', 'suffering', 'from', 'a', 'great', 'depression', 'because', 'five', 'months', 'ago', 'she', 'had', 'decided', 'to', 'show', 'herself', 'according', 'to', 'his', 'self', 'perceived', 'gender', 'the', 'rejection', 'she', 'received', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'her', 'to', 'make', 'that', 'decision', 'ariana', 'was', '24', 'years', 'old', 'and', 'had', 'worked', 'in', 'the', 'security', 'forces', 'for', 'six', 'years', 'in', 'the', 'last', 'five', 'months', 'she', 'had', 'decided', 'to', 'show', 'herself', 'as', 'she', 'was', 'and', 'began', 'her', 'transformation', 'but', 'that', 'according', 'to', 'her', 'friends', 'led', 'her', 'to', 'face', 'the', 'rejection', 'of', 'many', 'people', 'she', 'was', 'not', 'having', 'a', 'good', 'time', 'she', 'suffered', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'discrimination', 'at', 'work', 'she', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'with', 'her', 'family', 'they', 'were', 'very', 'closed', 'and', 'it', 'was', 'difficult', 'for', 'them', 'to', 'accept', 'her', 'as', 'she', 'was', 'that', 'led', 'her', 'to', 'feel', 'like', 'she', 'was', 'always', 'wrong', 'one', 'of', 'her', 'friends', 'told', 'sn', 'online']",ariana died by suicide she wa a police officer and wa suffering discrimination at work the incident occurred last night around 9 00 pm when the officer and two other officer were on board a patrol car carrying out their duty according to the police report at around 8 15 pm they stopped to buy food at the san justo shopping mall after which they resumed their tour while they were traveling through zapiola in the direction of peribebuy to route 3 they noticed that esquivel had a cell phone on which she wa receiving message minute later the witness said they heard an unexpected explosion and stopped the car thinking that a tyre had burst but when they got out they noticed that their partner wa injured in the back of the car meanwhile her regulation weapon a 9 mm pistol wa lying on the floor the officer wa immediately rushed to the solís clinic in the aforementioned town where medical attention wa given but unfortunately she died suicide of the trans police officer ariana suffered a lot of discrimination in her work a friend of the officer who committed suicide last night inside a patrol car told that she had been suffering from a great depression because five month ago she had decided to show herself according to his self perceived gender the rejection she received would have led her to make that decision ariana wa 24 year old and had worked in the security force for six year in the last five month she had decided to show herself a she wa and began her transformation but that according to her friend led her to face the rejection of many people she wa not having a good time she suffered a lot of discrimination at work she wa not well with her family they were very closed and it wa difficult for them to accept her a she wa that led her to feel like she wa always wrong one of her friend told sn online

According to information passed on by the victim's family, identified as Beatriz Souza, 38, the suspicion is that the ex-partner has put illegal substances in her drink, causing an overdose .  The main suspect had recorded videos of Beatriz dying inside the apartment. “There are several accounts. But what most people believe is that they put prohibited substances in her drink. And Pietra (ex-partner) filmed everything, saw her dying and was mocking her. It didn't help at all. We just want her to be remembered and justice to be done,” a cousin of Beatriz, who preferred not to be identified, told the report.  Beatriz grew up in the Cremação neighborhood of Belém. Her cousin did not know whether the family intends to bring the body to Brazil. “We spoke very little to each other. But she told her mother that if something ever happened, she didn't want her body brought here,” she said.Beatriz's ",2022.0,Neuilly-sur-Seine,1,"['beatriz', 'died', 'in', 'her', 'ex', ""partner's"", 'apartment', 'it', 'is', 'alleged', 'that', 'her', 'ex', 'partner', 'spiked', 'her', 'drink', 'with', 'prohibited', 'substances', 'and', 'then', 'filmed', 'her', 'dying', 'a', 'transgender', 'woman', 'from', 'pará', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'inside', 'an', 'apartment', 'in', 'the', 'early', 'hours', 'of', 'monday', '7', 'in', 'paris', 'france', 'according', 'to', 'information', 'passed', 'on', 'by', 'the', ""victim's"", 'family', 'identified', 'as', 'beatriz', 'souza', '38', 'the', 'suspicion', 'is', 'that', 'the', 'ex', 'partner', 'has', 'put', 'illegal', 'substances', 'in', 'her', 'drink', 'causing', 'an', 'overdose', 'the', 'main', 'suspect', 'had', 'recorded', 'videos', 'of', 'beatriz', 'dying', 'inside', 'the', 'apartment', 'there', 'are', 'several', 'accounts', 'but', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'believe', 'is', 'that', 'they', 'put', 'prohibited', 'substances', 'in', 'her', 'drink', 'and', 'pietra', 'ex', 'partner', 'filmed', 'everything', 'saw', 'her', 'dying', 'and', 'was', 'mocking', 'her', 'it', ""didn't"", 'help', 'at', 'all', 'we', 'just', 'want', 'her', 'to', 'be', 'remembered', 'and', 'justice', 'to', 'be', 'done', 'a', 'cousin', 'of', 'beatriz', 'who', 'preferred', 'not', 'to', 'be', 'identified', 'told', 'the', 'report', 'beatriz', 'grew', 'up', 'in', 'the', 'cremação', 'neighborhood', 'of', 'belém', 'her', 'cousin', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'whether', 'the', 'family', 'intends', 'to', 'bring', 'the', 'body', 'to', 'brazil', 'we', 'spoke', 'very', 'little', 'to', 'each', 'other', 'but', 'she', 'told', 'her', 'mother', 'that', 'if', 'something', 'ever', 'happened', 'she', ""didn't"", 'want', 'her', 'body', 'brought', 'here', 'she', 'said', ""beatriz's""]",beatriz died in her ex partner's apartment it is alleged that her ex partner spiked her drink with prohibited substance and then filmed her dying a transgender woman from pará wa found dead inside an apartment in the early hour of monday 7 in paris france according to information passed on by the victim's family identified a beatriz souza 38 the suspicion is that the ex partner ha put illegal substance in her drink causing an overdose the main suspect had recorded video of beatriz dying inside the apartment there are several account but what most people believe is that they put prohibited substance in her drink and pietra ex partner filmed everything saw her dying and wa mocking her it didn't help at all we just want her to be remembered and justice to be done a cousin of beatriz who preferred not to be identified told the report beatriz grew up in the cremação neighborhood of belém her cousin did not know whether the family intends to bring the body to brazil we spoke very little to each other but she told her mother that if something ever happened she didn't want her body brought here she said beatriz's

He confessed to committing the crime after an argument with Brenda.  The man, who confessed to Brenda's murder in testimony to the police, was released last Wednesday (23) after spending five days in temporary custody at the Pelotas Regional Prison . The judge who attended the case considered that the young man does not pose a risk to society. The court decision motivated the protest of Brenda's family and friends in downtown Gaucho. ""We are here to make a protest to demand justice, the police arrest and the justice released, he did not deserve to have gone through what he went through.He was an honest, dignified person and happened what happened.And the thug is there, loose, ""Carmem Lucia, Brenda's aunt, is indignant.

It was a moment when she was crying, how can I wish a happy Christmas to a mother who for days has lost a child? "" asked Patricia Duarte, sister of the victim.  The young man, who confessed to the crime, was indicted by the Civil Police for qualified homicide and theft, since he also stole Brenda's car. Police have requested his pre-trial detention, which has been denied by the courts. Therefore, he was released after the temporary arrest request expires. If the prosecution does not file a complaint, the juvenile may go freely until the day of the trial. The judiciary is in recess and will return to work on January 20.

Dee Whigham,25.0,2016-07-23,Mississippi,United States of America,30.443108,-88.853921,violence,stabbed,"Dee was found stabbed 119 times in a hotel room in the Best Western hotel in St. Martin, Mississippi. She had travelled to the town to attend the Gulf Coast Black Rodeo (GCBR) rodeo with friends.Two days after she was killed, a 20-year-old Navy seaman in training named Dwanya Hickerson was charged with capital murder for the crime. In July 2017 he was sentanced to 40 years for murder and 15 for robbery. For the last several years, the media has tracked the murders of transgender women in the United States. Since its creation last summer, Broadly has followed these crimes. There are several common threads that run throughout the killings of transgender women. The killers are nearly always men, the crimes often happen in the context of a sexual or romantic relationship, and the degree of violence perpetrated on their victims is extreme. For instance, running someone over and over with a truck, or stabbing someone 119 times. In December of 2015, Broadly asked the acclaimed gender theorist Judith Butler what the extreme nature of this violence might indicate. This was her reply:  ""It indicates that we are all living in a society in which such hideous and horrible things happen, and that there is nowhere near enough media attention paid to such matters. In fact, the popular media deflects from this aspect of trans existence when it should be raising our awareness and helping us to organize a systematic resistance to such violence. Perhaps the man who drives over the trans woman time and again cannot quite make her dead enough. At a certain point, she is already dead, but he is not finished killing her. Why? It is because he wants to obliterate any trace of his own relation to that living person, obliterating a part of himself and living person at the same time. But also establishing his absolute power, and his own masculinity as the site of that power. Perhaps he is rebuilding his gender as he continues to try to take apart and efface that trans woman who never deserved to die. He is seeking as well to establish a world in which no one like her exists.""",2016.0,Saint Martin,1,"['dee', 'was', 'found', 'stabbed', '119', 'times', 'in', 'a', 'hotel', 'room', 'in', 'the',

Ke’Yahonna Stone, a black transgender woman, was shot in a nightclub parking lot in Indianapolis in the early hours of December 26 and died two days later on December 28 after being taken off life support.  Stone, 32, attempted to break up a fight when someone pulled out a gun and began shooting, hitting her in the head, her family told local TV station WISH.   “I feel whoever did it, they moved off of impulse. Some things you got to walk away from. It don’t make you a punk or nothing to walk away,” Stone’s sister Latroya Rucker said. “She was breaking up a fight, trying to defuse a fight that was going on. My sister didn’t have nothing to do with nothing that was going on out there.”Ke'Yahonna was actively trying to create safe spaces for trans people and had just been hired to work at the Trans Solutions Research & Resource Center.

She was changing her life.”  Miller is the founder of Trans Solutions Research & Resource Center. Stone had recently been hired to work there. The plan was to take her idea of creating safe spaces and expand that to include spaces for the entire LGBTQ community.  “But, the community is hurting.

A 32-year-old [trans woman], identified as ""Cromada"", died after being shot on Monday night (27) in a bar in the Messejana neighborhood, in Fortaleza, Ceará. The crime happened a day before the LGBTQIA+ Pride Day celebrated this Tuesday (28).   Cromada was a personal friend of actor Silvero Pereira, who plays Zaquieu in TV   They killed my friend Chrome. Travesti, black, poor, peripheral. It's been a while since we've seen each other, nor spoken to each other, but rarely have I met such a good person, such a dear one. Chromada was the victim of a racist, transphobic, unequal system. Certainly if she had been socially accepted, she would never have made decisions that would lead to such tragedy.    According to information, Cromada was sitting in a chair on the sidewalk of the bar when she was hit by shots, dying on the spot. Teams of the Military Police and Forensic Experts of the State of Ceará (Pefoce) were called to the scene.

Fernanda Antelo,28.0,2020-05-31,Santa Cruz,Bolivia,-17.78369,-63.182104,medical,clinical neglect,"Fernanda was a homeless, HIV+ sex worker who died after 3 days attempting to get medical attention from various health centres who all refused to treat her. Fernanda Antelo was the name she used on the streets, a place where many trans people find their livelyhood, who suffer discrimination and lack of decent access to education from their early youth. She was evicted from the place she was renting and when she was left in the Lazareto center on Tuesday, she remained almost one day waiting for medical attention, according to Muriel Arteaga, the trans activist who tried to help her. Later, she was taken to her home, with some relatives, by Plan 3,000 and then to the Pueblo Nuevo center. There, they were told that she was putting staff and even those trying to help her at risk. With an order for the San Juan de Dios hospital, they got into a taxi. In that center, they told her that they could not attend her. It was Friday and they had to return to the relatives' house. On Saturday, exhausted and weak, she died while her friends were looking for someone to attend to her. This population is culturally and economically vulnerable, explains activist Álvaro Chuvé. His human rights are violated and he considers that he is the most affected of the entire lgbt + community. Chuvé says she was discriminated against five times: For being a woman, trans, poor, for having an illness and for being a sex worker. Activist Alex Bernabé says an investigation will be requested from the Ombudsman's Office.

She had been strangled inside a motel nearby. A transgender woman was murdered at a motel in Campeche, Florianópolis. Samantha do Valle, 20, was killed by a client after a program inside the establishment in the south of the island. The homicide occurred on February 6, but news was only released this Friday (21), after the director of the Civil Police in Greater Florianópolis, Eliane Chaves, commented on the case. A friend of Samantha who lives in São Paulo reported the disappearance of the young woman to the police. The family did not learn of her death until four days after her body was located. The Civil Police was called. According to Eliane, the man was arrested in the act and said only that he was Samantha's client. The case is treated as femicide. “Apparently, she was [doing sex work]. He [the killer] did not give a reason for the death. He was silent,” said the director.Samantha was from Paraná and had transitioned in adolescence. Her family were supportive. An uncle of Samantha, who asked not to have her name revealed, said the young woman had her social name on her identity documents, but her death certificate showed the wrong gender. The family plans to go to court to modify the document that attested to the girl's death. “I will go to court to change the name [in the document]. If she has a social name, it had to be in the documents. It's the law. It will not bring Samanta's life back, but we want to prevent other trans women and other human beings from being victims of these brutal cases,” said the man. Born in Paraná, Samantha spent her adolescence in São Paulo. According to the young woman's uncle, it was during this period that Samantha assumed her social name and began to plan for the future. Her desire was to take an eyebrow designer course or travel abroad. In an interview with nd + this Friday morning (21), the friend of the young woman spoke to her. According to them, Samantha was a quiet person and close to the family. They had known each other for about two years. On social networks, friends and family left messages for the young woman. “Evil has reached you, just you who had no evil.

Sasha María Rivas Martínez,25.0,2019-07-28,Capital,Venezuela,10.5162169,-66.9135789,medical,cosmetic filler poisoning,"Sasha died after a cosmetic filler injection.An autopsy revealed she had suffered an intracranial hemorrhage caused by the mixture of oils injected into her chest. [deadname] Rivas Martínez, 25 years old, a [trans woman] who identified herself as Sasha María died after an aesthetic treatment of breast enlargement with oil.  Sasha, who was doing the interventions to increase the size of the bust apparently went to an aesthetic center where in five sessions they would guarantee a considerable increase in size.  Last Saturday, July 27, the third of the interventions was carried out.  A transsexual woman, identified as Sasha María (25), died last weekend at the José María Vargas hospital in Caracas as a result of an intracranial hemorrhage caused by a mixture of oils. Sasha was admitted to the hospital after feeling strong discomfort in the body, after receiving the third injection of oil that was part of a treatment to increase the size of her breasts.  Sasha María, who in her identity document appeared under the name of [deadname] Rivas Martínez, said treatment was carried out in a clandestine ""aesthetic center"" in Caracas. The authorities reported that they are investigating where the premises are and who the owners are in order to punish those responsible. The young woman was an agronomist, a native of Ciudad Bolívar. She had emigrated to Caracas, apparently due to differences with her relatives, and resided in the town of Carapita, Antímano. More and more people are undergoing aesthetic treatments to change aspects of their body, especially increasing breasts and / or buttocks. However, those who do not have the economic means to pay for expensive treatments, resort to much more dangerous “solutions”, such as the use of oils without [medical] certification, reaching the extreme of using even olive oil, motor oil and glue.  In 2012, the Government of Venezuela banned silicone injections because of its health risk, however, according to figures from the Venezuelan Society of Aesthetic and Maxillofacial Plastic Reconstructive Surgery (Svcprem), 30% of Venezuelan women between 18 and 50 years in 2014 silicone injections were placed in the buttocks.

She had been an activist for over 30 years and was directly involved in the creation of laws to protect LGBT+ people, sex workers and women. Gloria Álvez passed away on Sunday, May 30 at the age of 78. With more than 30 years of activism for the rights of transgender people and the LGBTI community, she left an indelible legacy for new generations: the creation of the Sex Work Law (17.515), the Right to Gender Identity Law Violence:Lorrane de Souza (Petrolina - 19 Aug 2021)(18,620) and, more recently, the Comprehensive Law for Trans Persons (19,684). As a result of her participation in the design of these laws, for her tireless activism for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and her battle against the sexual exploitation of girls, boys and adolescents she was recognized nationally and internationally.  In 1990 Gloria founded the first trans collective in the country, whose name was the Transvestite Coordination Board, currently called the Uruguayan Trans Association (ATRU). She was its president and then its secretary. In recent years, she has also worked as the Uruguayan coordinator of the Latin American and Caribbean Network of Trans People (Redlactrans).  Gloria was a survivor. She went through the Children's Council in Salto, where she suffered abuse and mistreatment, was also confined in the Salto hospital and, during the dictatorship and post-dictatorship, resisted the confinement and torture imparted by police and military to trans people, called by they ""passive pedophiles."" In 1954, she served as a ""guinea pig"" for the doctors who applied the so-called ""sexual conversion therapy"", which consisted of giving electric shocks, recalled the Frente Amplio deputy Ana Olivera, who paid tribute to her in Parliament on Wednesday.

Vida Bruno,44.0,2021-04-06,Bahia,Brazil,-12.9920828,-38.4761597,violence,beaten,"Vida died in hospital on 6th April - allegedly as a result of head injuries sustained during an attack in a restaurant the previous November. Family members of the Coordinator of Policies and Promotion of LGBT Citizenship of the Municipality of Salvador, Vida Bruno, are going to call on the Public Ministry to reopen the investigation against the owners of the restaurant Cervantes, in the capital of Bahia, due to an episode of aggression reported by him before of his death.  Vida Bruno passed away at the age of 44 on Tuesday (6), after two months in the Teresa de Lisieux Hospital. According to administrator Elton Bruno Vida, 39, his brother was the victim of complications from a head trauma suffered inside the restaurant. ""He was beaten up inside. The reason for his death was transphobia and racism,"" accused Elton, referring to the fact that his brother is black and a trans man.  According to his brother, Vida Bruno had to undergo surgery to remove a brain clot diagnosed in the imaging tests he did shortly after the episode, but which he hid from his family for almost two months. ""We only found out when he was admitted, after fainting and complaining of headaches,"" reports Elton.  The aggression Elton refers to occurred on November 29, 2020, when Vida Bruno was alone at the Cervantes restaurant. He ordered a bottle of water and a starter of mussels, became sick and asked a waitress for help. From there, the story takes on completely different versions.  Bruno claimed that the owner of the restaurant said that he could not be ill there and ordered his withdrawal. As he was unable to walk, he was reportedly beaten with a blow to the head and dragged to the door with the help of ""two strong men"". Outside the establishment, the aggressions continued - including repeatedly banging his head against the floor.  At the time, Bruno reported to G1 that he was knocked out for a few seconds after receiving a rear naked choke. ""When I came to, I asked to be released, said that I was a worker, that I worked in the city hall, but, even so, the other man came, caught me by the legs and threw me in the street"", he said.  When the owner realized it was a trans man, he opened his shirt and exposed his breasts saying: 'This is not a man! This is a black bitch. ""  Vitor Viana, the lawyer for the restaurant, says that Vida Bruno had a seizure with bleeding from the nose and was immediately rescued by Cervantes employees and by two doctors who were at the scene. Disoriented, he left the establishment kicking the furniture and refused to be helped by Samu.  The family, however, says he had no history of a seizure. ""What happened was food poisoning, and this does not cause a seizure, a state of mental disorientation. Much less the picture of aggression reported by their lawyer,"" counters Elton.Vida was a historian and the coordinator of Policies and Promotion of LGBTI + Citizenship for the City of Salvador. He had actively fought for human rights, and was one of the founders of the LGBT Reference Center.Vida's Facebook, Twitter and Instagram profiles are   and ",2021.0,Salvador,1,"['vida', 'died', 'in',

Ebeng Mayor,28.0,2021-05-20,Central Luzon,Philippines,14.7763782,121.0343974,violence,raped and beaten,"Ebeng was nonbinary. Their beaten body was found three days after they had gone missing.Three suspects were subsequently arrested. Three days after going missing, Ebeng Mayor, a non-binary trans person, was found dead, bloodied, and bruised, with a wooden stick impaled in their genitals. It was believed that they were raped before being killed. Another victim, transgender woman Jhie Bangkiao, was found naked with a bloodied head in a cemetery.  Both members of the transgender community were found brutally murdered, a few days after the celebration of International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia, and Transphobia  These brutal murders are not just a loss of life– these are also crimes fueled by hate. This goes to show that the passage of the SOGIE Equality Bill is urgent. What transpired is a clear manifestation that the LGBT+ community is not safe in the country. This is not the first case of aggression and harassment towards the LGBT+ community. It is high time for the state to recognize that these are not isolated cases, rather attacks that are based on the SOGIE of the victims. We have been a target of harassment in society for a long time, and this will go on as long as perpetrators are not held accountable, and as long as the culture of violence and transphobia exists in the Philippines.  Bahaghari-UP Baguio Chapter expresses our deepest condolences to the families of the victims. We are one with the clamor for justice. Furthermore, we call on the authorities to conduct a full investigation regarding the cases of Ebeng and Junjie, and to hold those involved accountable. We also call on the government to pass the SOGIE Equality Bill immediately. The passage of the bill is set to make the country a safer space for the LGBT+ community as it ensures that crimes against the LGBT+ are held accountable.Ebeng's ",2021.0,Loma de Gato,1,"['ebeng', 'was', 'nonbinary', 'their', 'beaten', 'body', 'was', 'found', 'three', 'days', 'after', 'they', 'had', 'gone', 'missing', 'three', 'suspects', 'were', 'subsequently', 'arrested', 'three', 'days', 'after', 'going', 'missing', 'ebeng', 'mayor', 'a', 'non', 'binary', 'trans', 'person', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'bloodied', 'and', 'bruised', 'with', 'a', 'wooden', 'stick', 'impaled', 'in', 'their', 'genitals', 'it', 'was', 'believed', 'that', 'they', 'were', 'raped', 'before', 'being', 'killed', 'another', 'victim', 'transgender', 'woman', 'jhie', 'bangkiao', 'was', 'found', 'naked', 'with', 'a', 'bloodied', 'head', 'in', 'a', 'cemetery', 'both', 'members', 'of', 'the', 'transgender', 'community', 'were', 'found', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'a', 'few', 'days', 'after', 'the', 'celebration', 'of', 'international', 'day', 'against', 'homophobia', 'biphobia', 'interphobia', 'and', 'transphobia', 'these', 'brutal', 'murders', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'a', 'loss', 'of', 'life', 'these', 'are', 'also', 'crimes', 'fueled', 'by', 'hate', 'this', 'goes', 'to', 'show', 'that', 'the', 'passage', 'of', 'the', 'sogie', 'equality', 'bill', 'is', 'urgent', 'what', 'transpired', 'is', 'a', 'clear', 'manifestation', 'that', 'the', 'lgbt', 'community', 'is', 'not', 'safe', 'in', 'the', 'country', 'this', 'is', 'not', 'the', 'first', 'case', 'of', 'aggression', 'and', 'harassment', 'towards', 'the', 'lgbt', 'community', 'it', 'is', 'high', 'time', 'for', 'the', 'state', 'to', 'recognize', 'that', 'these', 'are', 'not', 'isolated', 'cases', 'rather', 'attacks', 'that', 'are', 'based', 'on', 'the', 'sogie', 'of', 'the', 'victims', 'we', 'have', 'been', 'a', 'target', 'of', 'harassment', 'in', 'society', 'for', 'a', 'long', 'time', 'and', 'this', 'will', 'go', 'on', 'as', 'long', 'as', 'perpetrators', 'are', 'not', 'held', 'accountable', 'and', 'as', 'long', 'as', 'the', 'culture', 'of', 'violence', 'and', 'transphobia', 'exists', 'in', 'the', 'philippines', 'bahaghari', 'up', 'baguio', 'chapter', 'expresses', 'our', 'deepest', 'condolences', 'to', 'the', 'families', 'of', 'the', 'victims', 'we', 'are', 'one', 'with', 'the', 'clamor', 'for', 'justice', 'furthermore', 'we', 'call', 'on', 'the', 'authorities', 'to', 'conduct', 'a', 'full', 'investigation', 'regarding', 'the', 'cases', 'of', 'ebeng', 'and', 'junjie', 'and', 'to', 'hold', 'those', 'involved', 'accountable', 'we', 'also', 'call', 'on', 'the', 'government', 'to', 'pass', 'the', 'sogie', 'equality', 'bill', 'immediately', 'the', 'passage', 'of', 'the', 'bill', 'is', 'set', 'to', 'make', 'the', 'country', 'a', 'safer', 'space', 'for', 'the', 'lgbt', 'community', 'as', 'it', 'ensures', 'that', 'crimes', 'against', 'the', 'lgbt', 'are', 'held', 'accountable', ""ebeng's""]",ebeng wa nonbinary their beaten body wa found three day after they had gone missing three suspect were subsequently arrested three day after going missing ebeng mayor a non binary trans person wa found dead bloodied and bruised with a wooden stick impaled in their genitals it wa believed that they were raped before being killed another victim transgender woman jhie bangkiao wa found naked with a bloodied head in a cemetery both member of the transgender community were found brutally murdered a few day after the celebration of international day against homophobia biphobia interphobia and transphobia these brutal murder are not just a loss of life these are also crime fueled by hate this go to show that the passage of the sogie equality bill is urgent what transpired is a clear manifestation that the lgbt community is not safe in the country this is not the first case of aggression and harassment towards the lgbt community it is high time for the state to recognize that these are not isolated case rather attack that are based on the sogie of the victim we have been a target of harassment in society for a long time and this will go on a long a perpetrator are not held accountable and a long a the culture of violence and transphobia exists in the philippine bahaghari up baguio chapter express our deepest condolence to the family of the victim we are one with the clamor for justice furthermore we call on the authority to conduct a full investigation regarding the case of ebeng and junjie and to hold those involved accountable we also call on the government to pas the sogie equality bill immediately the passage of the bill is set to make the country a safer space for the lgbt community a it ensures that crime against the lgbt are held accountable ebeng's

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - The gruesome killing on Saturday of a second transgender woman in northern Mexico has unnerved the local transgender community and amplified calls for greater protections in the Latin American nation.  The murder of Leslie Rocha in the border city of Ciudad Juarez [at calle Otumba 2900 in colonia San Francisco] came days after a transgender civil society group staged a protest there to demand greater protection.  Those demands were sparked by the murder late of Ciudad Juarez-born transgender activist Mireya Rodriguez Lemus, whose body was found earlier this week in Aquiles Serdan, a town in the northern Chihuahua state.  A transgender woman in Ciudad Juarez, who declined to give her name, said people are ""a little scared, a little terrified"" to go out on the streets.

Hers was the second reported LGBTI murder in the area in a month.At around midday on 27th December at around midday Phoebe went with a neighbour’s child to an informal shop in the town of Wolseley to buy iced lollies.According to reports received by LGBTI rights group Triangle Project while there she accidentally stepped on the toes of a 15-year-old boy at the store. The furious youth responded by allegedly shouting homophobic and transphobic slurs, including “vuil moffie” (dirty faggot) at her.After being repeatedly verbally abused by the teen, Titus told a friend’s mother across the road from the shop that she was “sick of being called names.” Annoyed, the woman picked up a plastic crate and gestured with it to the youth.It’s alleged that a man in his twenties near the shop then handed a knife to the boy, who  plunged it into Phoebe’ neck.Bleeding profusely, she staggered away, collapsing and dying about 500 metres down the road in a pool of blood. “I think she’d just had enough of being called names,” an emotional Sharon Cox, Triangle’s Health and Support Services Manager, told Mambaonline. “She was beautiful and was loved in the community.

"Veronica Oliveira (""Mãe Loira"")",40.0,2019-12-12,Rio Grande do Sul,Brazil,-29.6973746,-53.8210365,violence,stabbed,"Veronica was stabbed in the early hours of Thursday 12th December. She was the founder of a transgender women's housing project in her neighborhood. Residents of the Urlândia neighborhood, in the southern Santa Maria region, and the LGBTQ + community are disgusted by the death of Veronica Oliveira, 40 , murdered in the early hours of Thursday on Avenida Borges de Medeiros [and Avenida Presidente Vargas] in the Nossa Senhora de Fátima neighborhood. In social networks, those who met Veronica or her work, expressed regretting the crime and remembering her life. According to the report, Veronica's colleagues who were at the scene said that a man arrived by car and offered them $50 to make a program [have sex] with him. After they refused, the man called Veronica, who was among the group, and when she approached the vehicle he stabbed her. Veronica was the founder of a transgender women's housing project in the neighborhood. Veronica Alojamento was created 13 years ago and is considered a reference in Santa Maria and the state, being the only one in the city. There, she welcomed transgender women who are often expelled from home by their family and come from various locations across the country. Today about 20 girls live in the accommodation. Marquita Quevedo, founder of the NGO Equality and friend of Veronica, says that the victim's friends and family are outraged by the violent death: ""It was another big loss for the trans movement.

AHMEDABAD: A transgender woman named Mamta was stabbed to death by her lover Ajay Nadia, 30, of Sardarnagar, late on Tuesday night. Fearing that the killing may trigger a war between groups of [transgender people], if the accused was transgender too, senior cops rushed to the spot. But during the primary investigation it became clear that Nadia had killed her. Hemant Patel, inspector of Sardarnagar police station said that within hours of the incident they arrested Nadia, who was also injured and admitted in a hospital. “We suspect there were two accused. We will identify the second accused as soon as Nadia is discharged,” Patel said. Patel added that Nadia and Mamta had been living together for some time. “They were in love and Nadia had also tattooed the Mamta’s name on his forearm. However, after some time Mamta came to know that Nadia is also in love with a woman. This triggered frequent fights between Nadia and Mamta,” Patel said.  Police officials said during interrogation it came to light that Nadia used to take money from Mamta and spend it to woo the woman. This enraged Mamta. “On Tuesday night Mamta had a fight with Nadia on the same issue. Nadia lost his temper and stabbed Mamta several times, killing Mamta on the spot.

"Beyonce ""Eric” Lee",21.0,2009-07-26,Louisiana,United States of America,29.950621,-90.074948,violence,stabbed,"Lee was a drag performer who dressed and performed as the famous singer Beyonce and was transitioning. She was stabbed to death in her home after an argument with three women. New Orleans, LA – The Times-Picayune and Advocate.com report the Sunday murder of a victim who presented femininely and referred to herself as “Beyoncé,” in tribute to the popular star of soul and pop/rock, Beyoncé Knowles. The victim, Eric Lee, 21, was stabbed repeatedly at an apartment complex [at the 3500 block of Garden Oaks Drive] in the Algiers neighborhood. Police found Lee’s slashed body inside a first-floor apartment. Witnesses say they heard Lee arguing heatedly with a group of women before the time of the murder. While police have not announced a suspected motive for the killing, the m.o. fits a transphobic hate crime pattern.

The perpetrator was arrested following evidence gained by an IP camera near the crime scene and confessed to the murder. Channarong Sonnuam was found dead at the back of Makro recently. The 21-year-old [trans woman]’s head was hit to death with a broken piece of concrete. Bophut police also found evidence of sexual assault to the victim. Some nine days after, the police arrested Somchok Chungchiaw, who works as a jet ski shop attendant in Chaweng, about 800 meters from the crime scene. The investigating team, led by Bophut Police superintendent Pol. Col.Phayoongsak Surin, said that after the review of the IP camera near the scene and the victim’s mobile phone call history, they had sufficient evidence to apprehend Somchok. Somchok pleaded guilty of killing Channarong but denied raping the victim. The suspect said that he had been so angry when his wife left him and wanted to do something extreme.

"Crismilly Pérola (""Piu Piu"", ""Bombom"")",37.0,2021-07-05,Pernambuco,Brazil,-8.0463287,-34.9963887,violence,beaten and shot,"Crismilly was found dead on a public road near the Caxangá bridge in the Beira Rio community. She had been beaten and shot. A trans woman was shot dead this Monday (5), in the Beira Rio community, in Várzea, West Zone of Recife. The 37-year-old hairdresser used the social name of Crismilly Pearl and was also known as Bombom or Piu-piu. The family believes that the crime was motivated by transphobia, which occurs when there is prejudice against those who identify themselves as transgender.  This is the third serious case of violence against trans women in less than a month. On June 18, the body of [Kalyndra  was found inside her house, at Ipsep in the south of Recife. On the 24th of the Same Month [Roberta da Silva]() had 40% of her body burned by a teenager at the Center.  Investigations into Crismilly's case were initiated by the Department of Homicide and Personal Protection (DHPP). According to criminal expert Diego Nunes, from the Specialized Group of Expertise in Homicide (GEPH), of the DHPP, the body was found on the banks of the Capibaribe River. ""The victim had a gunshot in the hand that deflected and hit her neck. She was wearing denim shorts and shorts, and there was no sign of sexual violence,"" he said.  According to the family, she had left home, where she lived with her family near the place, at night, saying that she would go to friends' houses.  The hairdresser's cousin, Jennnifer Matos, 25, said she had recently been a victim of transphobia and was hospitalized because she fractured one of her arms. The family believes that the motive was the same. ""It was a month ago, in a fight in Várzea as well. They tried to take her life. And the reason for what we know was transphobia. there was always that. that the police investigate and identify the culprits. She was a very dear person,"" he said.A teenager was subsequently arrested for her murder. According to police, his only motive was transphobic hatred. This Monday (26) the Civil Police gave details of the murder of a trans woman in the West Zone of Recife on July 5th. According to delegate Euricélia Nogueira, the teenager who was apprehended for the death of Crismily Pérola, 37 , committed the crime ""out of pure hatred"". The policewoman said the boy claimed he killed the victim, ""because she wanted to be what she wasn't"". ""He was upset, because only one shot hit her. Then, he took a shovel and hit the victim more while she was still alive. Not finding it enough, he dragged Crismilly for approximately 20 meters and then threw it into a river. There was no cause. She was at a party and the minor was bothered by her presence,"" said the delegate.Crismilly was the third trans woman murdered in Pernambuco in less than a month. On 18th June, the body of [Kalyndra  was found inside her home in Ipsep in the south of Recife. Her partner was indicted for femicide on Monday 26th July.

She was one of two trans women killed in Patna in 24 hours - the other being [Usha  on 20th December. Patna: Frightened and angry over the killing of two transgenders in Patna in the last 24 hours, dozens of transgenders protested and shouted slogans against the Nitish Kumar-led National Democratic Alliance government on Tuesday for “failing to protect them”.  Anger in the community boiled over after a transgender [woman] identified as Soni was shot dead at Chiraiyatad Bridge, near Kankarbagh locality, on Tuesday morning.  The protesting transgenders placed Soni’s body on a road and burned tyres near Sri Ram Hospital, disrupting traffic for hours. “Soni was shot dead while returning from a birthday party,” Lakshmi, one of the protesters, told Newsclick. According to the police, the protesters damaged some vehicles and forced the nearby shops and markets to shut down.  The protesters sought security in Patna in view of the murder of the two transgenders in separate incidents. “We are not safe and scared after the killings. If transgenders are not safe, who will be safe?” added Lakshmi.  Another protester Mohini said that the police didn’t take action because the victim was a transgender [woman]. “Instead, the police used force to disperse the protesting transgenders,” Mohini said.  In another incident, a transgender identified as Usha Rani was found murdered at her house at Machua Toli, under Alamganj Police Station, on Monday. The police have confirmed it a case of murder and started an investigation.

Several transgenders expressed fear over the murders. “We are widely considered the safest community but the killings of the two transgenders have caused fear and panic among us.

Marilyn Monroe Cazares,22.0,2020-07-13,California,United States of America,32.978318,-115.5263422,violence,stabbed and burned,"Marilyn was found dead in an abandoned building after first responders answered a fire call in the early hours of Monday 13th July.According to her family she had been stabbed and her body burned. In yet another incident highlighting the struggles trans people face to be treated with dignity and respect, a transgender woman was found murdered [in the 1100 block on Main St] in the Southern California suburb of Brawley on July 13. Marilyn Cazares, 22, was found dead in an abandoned building as first responders answered a fire call in the early hours of Monday morning. In the wake of what was described as a “horrific” and “hateful” killing, news reports and Cazares’s family have continued to use the name and pronouns by which she was assigned at birth. Police are investigating the incident as a homicide, although they currently have very little information about the circumstances. According to the local news outlet KYMA-13, which misgenders her in their reporting, Cazares experienced homelessness and lived in the building where she was apparently murdered. Cazares’s aunt, Mindy Garcia, said she was loved for her charisma, describing her as brave, outspoken, and a very beautiful person. Cazares could be seen walking “down Main Street all the time looking beautiful with her head held up high,” Garcia said. “That’s how she should be remembered.”On Saturday 1st August a march and vigil was held in her memory.

Chanel Siqueiros,24.0,2015-12-20,Sonora,Mexico,29.089415,-110.961238,suicide,suicide,"Chanel died by suicide after being the victim of transphobic bullying. The young woman, barely 24 years old, had suffered transphobic bullying from transgender partners and gay men from her LGBT community, which led her to death by suicide this past December 20, according to close sources consulted by the activist blog Trans Pride. He announced this unfortunate news.  As Trans Pride says:  ""Year after year transgender people, transsexuals or transvestites from all over the world end their lives because of hatred and rejection of society, in most cases of society in general but in some others that rejection comes from the same 'LGBT community' for not 'complying' with the stereotypes dictated by a normative society.  ""Chanel was a victim of ignorance, of despair and loneliness and that is why projects like Trans Pride must reach more people in this situation because we believe that together and together we can end this.  ""Transgender and transsexual women do not have to suffer this type of violence (regardless of who comes from), trans women do not have to force us to 'comply' with the stereotypes dictated by society. Our physicist does not determine the level of our femininity, transgender women are women independently of our characteristics and nobody has to violate us and hurt us by telling us otherwise.

Name Unknown,15.0,2021-03-04,Western Australia,Australia,-31.952712,115.86048,suicide,suicide,"The victim was a young trans boy. After his parents couldn't agree on funeral arrangements he was given two funerals - one in his chosen name, and one in his deadname. A 15-year-old who tragically died by suicide has been given two separate funerals after his parents argued over his gender in court.  The Perth schoolboy – who cannot be named for legal reasons – died on 4 March in hospital, days after attempting to take his life, Perth Now reported. After his death, the teen’s estranged parents went to the Family Court of Western Australia after they failed to agree on his funeral arrangements, including which name to put on their son’s headstone.  The boy’s father reportedly wanted his son’s deadname – the name assigned to the teen before he came out as trans – on his headstone. But his mother said she wanted to use the name her son chose when he came out as transgender.  The boy’s mother told the West Australian that her son “would hate” to be deadnamed at his memorial. She said: “[His father] wanted all the ashes [interred together] and [his son’s birth name] on the plaque.  “I would agree to have [the birth name] in brackets but his [chosen name] first.”  Eventually, the parents agreed to split their son’s ashes and put both names on any memorial plaques. However, the 15-year-old’s deadname will appear on his death certificate because, before his death, he was unable to legally change it on his birth certificate. Loved ones described the 15-year-old as “a good and caring friend who always listened” and an “amazing artist who was great at drawing, painting and make-up”.  When he was 14, the teen was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but his mum didn’t find out until the day before he died.  His mum said she couldn’t be sure whether knowing about the disorder would have kept him alive but said she would have given him more support.  “He needed more supervision than what he was getting,” she said.  “Risk-taking is part of BPD... if I had just known about the diagnosis ... he was only 14.”  Before his death, the boy was referred to Perth’s Gender Diversity Service, an outpatient service for children experiencing gender diversity issues.  He had also run away from home and had stopped taking his antidepressant medication.",2021.0,Perth,0,"['the', 'victim', 'was', 'a', 'young', 'trans', 'boy', 'after', 'his', 'parents', ""couldn't"",

My beloved community, we have another loss.  Another death to mourn.  Safe Passage to young brother Mac Ohana, who was 18, and from Bellingham, Washington. Recent posts from Mac indicate that he was in crisis a few nights ago (November 26th), and he checked himself into the hospital, seeking help, only to be faced with transphobia and severe rules designed to ""convert"" or ""cure"" him of being transgender.  THIS is UNACCEPTABLE.  Mac might still be alive if he had been seen and respected when he sought help.  The treatment he received (see second photo for his own testimony) was unprofessional and, indeed, inhuman. I will be adding more details about Mac's life and his passing as I receive them.  It is known that his last FB post was put up on December 2.     Western Washington University Woodring College of Education subsequently setup a scholarship programme for students aspiring to, or with experience working with, high-risk youth in his memory.  Can I rant about the mental health system and how screwed up it is? I have been trying to get a  for months now. I was recommended by my counselor to see this Primary Physician through Squalicum Family Medicine for psych meds. At the time of my appointment, I was just about to get my first shot of Testosterone. The doctor was incredibly nice. She offered to take over prescribing and monitoring my Testosterone from Planned Parenthood. I was more coming to her for psych meds, but it was nice to get an all-in-one stop. Primary Care, Testosterone, AND psych meds? Sweet! She said that Testosterone is a big change, and she felt hesitant giving me psych meds right as I started. I agreed. We agreed to wait after 2 shots (two weeks) and then she'd prescribe me something. I came back to her after two shots, and suddenly she didn't want to prescribe to me anymore. She said, ""I think you should see a psychiatrist."" Uh, but you said after two shots, you'd get me an anti-depressant? Nope. I could have used those two weeks out of the months it takes to get an appointment at all with a psychiatrist. Thanks though.  Today I went to Unity Care NW (formerly Interfaith) for my appointment. Let me tell you what a bitch it was to just get one. First, I had to call the RSN line on Monday before 8am, because getting in there was super competitive and they only took 10 people a week. So I called right at 8am and got the last slot. Sweet! I was supposed to get a call from Unity Care NW that day. I didn't. So I called the next day and left a message. Didn't get a call back from them for about a week, and finally was playing phone tag with this woman in charge of intake appointments. FINALLY I got a hold of her, and she said to get a psychiatrist, I had to see a counselor through their program. I told her I already have a counselor and it's taken me a long time to establish that relationship and its annoying to have two, so I asked her to let me think about it for a few days. I called back twice a week for 3 weeks and couldn't get a hold of her after I decided. FINALLY, she scheduled me 3 weeks out for an intake. I go in there today, and I meet her for the first time and she says, ""Well, since you have a counselor already like you said over the phone, I don't think you can be in this program. You'll have to give up your counselor and see ours, or we can't take you."" BITCH! YOU MADE ME GO THROUGH ALL THIS EFFORT TO TELL ME THIS NOW?! oh my god. I cannot believe how much self-advocating one has to do just to get damn services. It's unbelievable. I feel so lucky to be able to be in a place in my life where I can, but what about all the people that can't? People seeking services are generally in a very vulnerable and fragile state and cannot do all of this by themselves. It's unbelievable what the system expects us to do. Mental illness can be crippling and it should not be this difficult to get services.

She died in hospital.  Ciudad Juárez.- A man who dressed as a woman was shot to death by several men traveling in a recent Nissan Versa car, in events that took place this Saturday afternoon in the streets of the Juarez neighborhood, in the western part of the city , police authorities reported.

Townsel then retrieved the knife from her apartment that she used to stab the victim. Police records say that when Collin (sic) continued to yell at her, Townsel stabbed [her] and left [her] lying in the grass.  “One witness says Collins asked her for help and when she attempted to perform CPR, Townsel threatened her. The witness returned to her apartment to call authorities.”Like most trans murder victims in the USA, Jasmine was a trans woman of colour.

An inquest into his death is due to take place on 2nd February 2021. A coroner has opened the inquest into the death of a teenager who died after being hit by a train .  Ellis Murphy-Richards, 15, fell from a railway bridge on the Isle of Sheppey on Wednesday, September 30, after visiting a mental health counsellor in Sheerness.  He had been living with his grandmother in Faversham although his mother Natasha Murphy, 33, lives in [redacted].Classmates organised a memorial to Ellis on Saturday 17th October, and the site  was setup in his memory. This site is a tribute to Ellis Murphy-Richards. He is much loved by his friends and family and will always be remembered.   Ellis was very musical and incredibly bright. He had taken violin lessons, had his own guitar and also learned to play the nose flute (which divided audiences!) Ellis even learned British Sign Language so he could sing along to pop songs. A born performer, Ellis could be heard from far and wide, he was very silly and jokey and a star quiz master at family Christmases.   Ellis was very passionate about LGBTQ+ rights, equality and diversity. We have chosen the charity MindOut for Ellis' tribute donations, which is a wonderful charity supporting those from the LGBTQ+ community who experience mental ill health. We are asking people to donate, rather than buying flowers. Thank you.   We will always look up and remember you, our beautiful star in the sky.

Royal Poetical Starz,26.0,2021-10-02,Florida,United States of America,25.9421989,-80.278828,violence,shot,"Poetical was shot inside her vehicle late on the morning of Saturday 2nd October. As a result of police misgendering her murder did not come to light until nearly two weeks later. A 26-year-old Black transgender woman from Pompano Beach was gunned down and killed late morning Saturday, Oct. 2, inside her Hummer on a residential Miami Gardens street.  Royal Poetical Starz is believed to be one of at least 40 trans, nonbinary or  people reported slain this year in the United States, according to queer blogger Sue Kerr, who tracks these killings for her website, Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents.   Kerr and South Florida trans activists, including Morgan and Ashley Mayfaire of TransSOCIAL, were stunned to learn from a reporter on Tuesday that a trans woman had been shot to death the week before in Northwest Miami-Dade County.  A prime reason they didn’t know: Miami Gardens police on Oct. 4 issued a news release stating that a 26-year-old “Black male” had been slain — alongside a photo of Poetical presenting herself as a woman.  Investigators haven’t said much about Poetical’s death, except it “occurred at the 4600 Block of NW 185th Street, in Miami Gardens” about 11:26 a.m., according to the police news release.

Miriam Rivera,38.0,2019-02-05,Sonora,Mexico,29.089415,-110.961238,violence,hanged,"Miriam died in suspicious circumstances. She was a member of the House of Xtravaganza who appeared in Big Brother Australia and the UK TV show ""There’s Something About Miriam"". Shocking new details have surfaced about the mysterious death of transgender reality star Miriam Rivera. Miriam, who appeared on Big Brother Australia in 2004 and British dating show There’s Something About Miriam, died aged 38 in Hermosillo, Mexico on February 5. Her death wasn’t reported until this week, and Daily Mail Australia can now reveal that family members were threatened if they tried to investigate what happened. In an exclusive interview from his home in New York, Miriam’s husband Daniel Cuervo said that he suspects she met with a violent end. Mr Cuervo claimed an unknown male had called him when he was trying to arrange Miriam’s funeral and said: ‘Don’t come back to Mexico or we’ll kill you too’. He later found out her body had already been cremated, leaving no opportunity to perform an autopsy, which he found ‘very suspicious’. Because he feared for his safety, Mr Cuervo wasn’t able to arrange a proper funeral for his wife. Photos have since surfaced on Facebook of a decidedly low-key memorial service. Mr Cuervo believes his wife’s death may have been ‘passed off’ as a suicide after she refused to accept work as a prostitute for a man who was ‘infatuated’ with her. He recalled the day Miriam died: ‘On the morning of February 5, Miriam called me [in New York] from Mexico, telling me she was feeling sick and vomiting blood, so I told her to go to the hospital. ‘She called me again before leaving the hospital at 12pm and that was the last time we spoke.’. At 2pm, Miriam was found dead by hanging at her home in Hermosillo. In November 2021, an investigative podcast series about the series titled [Harsh  was released. Podcast studio Wondery has set up “[Harsh ),” a six-part investigative series on trans reality TV star Miriam Rivera’s controversial 2004 British reality dating show “There’s Something About Miriam.” The series aims to unpack the true story of the show, starring Mexican model Rivera, which aired on Sky. Set in a villa in Ibiza, the series followed six men who competed for a cash prize and for the love of Rivera. The show — produced by Remy Blumenfeld’s Brighter Pictures, which later became Remarkable under Endemol Shine U.K. — revealed she was transgender, but only in the final episode. The series is written by Agnes Borinsky and produced by Eleanor Biggs. Executive producers are Max O’Brien and Morgan M. Page for Novel and George Lavender, Marshall Lewy and Jen Sargent for Wondery. Trace Lysette, best known for her recurring role as Shea on Amazon series “Transparent,” serves as host. Lysette said: “Like many trans women from the 90s era and before, Miriam was a woman ahead of her time; a diamond in the rough that the world couldn’t appreciate in the way she deserved. I had the pleasure of knowing Miriam through NYC nightlife and the ballroom scene. She was a part of the House of Xtravaganza when I was earning my stripes in the House of Angel in the early 00’s. She was always kind to me and I feel honored to help bring this podcast about her life to the listeners. I hope she can finally be celebrated and appreciated for the pioneer that she was.”Miriam's IMDB profile is ",2019.0,Hermosillo,1,"['miriam', 'died', 'in', 'suspicious', 'circumstances', 'she', 'was',

"Elisha Chanel Stanley (""Elisha Diamond"")",46.0,2019-09-16,Pennsylvania,United States of America,40.4442902,-79.9970007,uncategorised,not reported,"Elisha was found dead while visiting family in downtown Pittsburgh on Monday 16th September. The circumstances of her death have not yet been confirmed. A Black transgender woman named Elisha Chanel Stanley — better known to some as Elisha Diamond — was found dead in Downtown Pittsburgh on Sept. 16. The circumstances of Stanley’s death have not yet been determined by the Allegheny County Medical  Chris Togneri, public information officer for Pittsburgh’s department of safety, confirmed there is an open investigation into her death but declined to provide any further comment in an email Tuesday afternoon. According to the Allegheny County Medical Elisha was a professional mental health care worker who was working for MBI Health Services LLC in Washington DC. She had gone back to Pittsburgh to be with family. Stanley was in Pittsburgh to visit some close friends, according to Ferguson, including themself and another of her “children."" Ferguson describes Stanley as their “gay mother.” “People don’t really understand where that term comes from,” Ferguson says. “There are a lot of runaways, and displaced and abused people in the community. Without being funded by any government organization, there are people [in this community] who have taken these people on and moved them in, clothed them, fed them, taken them to school, and really played that part as a mentor in their lives and those are all the things she did for me.” Stanley and Ferguson first met in the late '90s. At the time, Ferguson says Stanley allowed them to move in while they were living in a shelter after having been kicked out. In 2002, Stanley moved to D.C. to “become the woman she wanted to be from the inside out,” and Ferguson moved with her. Ferguson returned to Pittsburgh in 2005 and now is a father in the way Stanley was a mother to them. “She was my friend, someone who protected me, there was nothing she wouldn’t do for someone. She took me in and loved me like her own flesh and blood,” says Ferguson. “She spent her life opening doors for women like herself.”Elisha's ",2019.0,Pittsburgh,0,"['elisha', 'was', 'found', 'dead',

"Nikhia Williams (""Nikki"")",29.0,2008-08-30,Kentucky,United States of America,38.257069,-85.7774033,violence,shot,"Nikki was found lying on the ground next to a dumpster outside her apartment on Wednesday 20th August after being shot by a group of four men. She died in hospital 10 days later on 30th August. A transgender woman shot during a home invasion dies ten days later. Detectives, of course, are treating this case as a homicide. Neighbors were afraid to talk on camera because the attackers are still on the loose. But one man said he found 29-year old Nakhia Williams lying on the ground outside her apartment [at the 1500 block] on West Market Street. Police say Williams was rushed to the hospital the morning of August 20th and died this past Saturday, the 30th. The medical examiner says Williams died from a gunshot wound, which complicated a medical condition she already had. Police say another person was home with Williams during the home invasion. ""There was possibly four black males who had forced the victim and another occupant to the ground, a lot of commotion going on,"" said LMPD Detective Phil Russell. No one is saying who this other occupant is and whether he or she was injured.On 16th December 2008, the blogger Monica Roberts wrote this about her: Today would have been Nakhia 'Nikki' Williams' 30th birthday. She and her twin sister Nicole would have been celebrating it together. But unfortunately that won't happen because some scumbag who's still at large right now felt he had the power to take her life. And that has left a void in the lives of all who knew her. A family is missing a loved one. The people who called her 'friend' miss her terribly. Her neighbors who she greeted with a friendly wave, a hello and a smile no longer hear or see that. A community mourns for you. And a creative, artistic soul has been extinguished.

He was on the waiting list for an NHS gender identity clinic and struggled with the delays involved.Gender identity clinic (""GIC"") provision in the UK is extremely inadequate given the size of the trans population, resulting in long waiting lists (typically 18-24 months, and rising) for even a first appointment. During this period, no in-person support is offered and patients are basically left to cope on their own. Giving evidence at an inquest into his death held at Pontypridd Coroner's Court on Thursday, Mr Whelan's close friend Joshua Barnett said he had been suffering with numerous medical issues including type one diabetes, coeliac disease, dyspraxia, and dyslexia for much of his life.  Mr Barnett said this, on top of his decision to begin to transition his gender in 2017, had been the source of a tremendous amount of ""frustration"" for Mr Whelan.  ""There were two different aspects to it,"" Mr Barnett said. ""It was the medical side where he was finding it very difficult to wait for the appointments he wanted.

Tamara Denise Morales,36.0,2020-04-27,Buenos Aires,Argentina,-34.5107497,-58.528409,violence,stabbed,"Tamara's body was found partially clothed and lying in a ditch of water, a day after she had been discharged from hospital - despite having a fever.  A 36-year-old trans woman was found this Tuesday in a ditch, semi-covered with water, in Pablo Nogués, a Malvinas Argentinas district. This is Tamara Denise Morales, who had several health problems recently.  Days before her discovery, the woman was transferred by ambulance from the house in Villa de Mayo, where she lived with her family, to the Malvinas Argentinas hospital guard. She felt ill, and they were going to perform various tests, including a coronavirus test.  She was in the hospital between 8pm and 3am, when - according to the hospital - she requested voluntary discharge and left. Her family and friends did not know more about her and on Sunday they desperately asked on the networks that if someone had seen her to communicate with them.  “The prosecution told us that just in seven days they will have the result of the autopsy, which seems very strange to us because it is true that she signed her voluntary discharge, but she was ill. She had a high fever and he was not in her right mind to leave” Roberto Morales, Tamara's brother, told minuteuno.com.  ""She was found semi-nude in a ditch, and everything seems strange to us."" ""We do not want to venture to say anything, but it seems to us that the local hospital should not let her go, or at least notify the family of the situation,"" he added.

Estefani Rodrigues Soares,18.0,2022-05-14,Rio Grande do Norte,Brazil,-5.8174671,-35.2075664,violence,stabbed,"Estefani was stabbed by her ex-boyfriend. He was arrested and confessed to her murder. The ex-boyfriend of the young trans woman who was stabbed to death this Saturday (14), in Natal, was arrested and confessed to the crime, according to the Civil Police. A video taken by investigators shows the attack. According to delegate Adson Kleper, the 28-year-old man should answer for femicide.  The victim was officially identified as Estefani Rodrigues Soares, 18 years old. She was killed in a square on Rua Desembargador Carlos Augusto, in Lagoa Nova, in the South Zone of the capital.  An app driver heard the young woman's cries for help and saw her body lying on the ground. He even tried to follow the suspect she ran away from. The knife used in the crime was found in the square.  After being called the Military Police managed to arrest the author of the crime in the Nova Descoberta neighborhood.  The man was injured with a cut on his hand and was taken to UPA Potengi, to be treated, before being taken to the duty of the Specialized Police Station for Assistance to Women, in the North Zone of the capital.  According to the delegate, during the deposition, the man confessed that the crime was premeditated. He also said that he had a falling out with the victim in January and she stabbed him. He then told the delegate that he denounced the aggression, but saw that the investigation was not progressing and decided to act on his own, arranging a meeting and killing the young woman.  Despite the version of revenge presented by the aggressor, the case was registered as a femicide, because of the relationship between him and the victim, according to the delegate.

Sylva,40.0,2018-08-04,Connaught,Ireland,53.274412,-9.049063,custodial,died in custody,"Sylva was an asylum seeker who had been detained for a year.She died in custody on 4th August 2018 in the men's wing of a Direct Provision centre in Galway. Just heard the heartbreaking news about a trans woman found dead in direct provision. We need to end the horrific practice of Direct Provision. Seeking asylum is not a crime so why are we locking up asylum seekers! #EndDirectProvision #DublinTransPrideIn early June 2019 the local LGBT+ community discovered that the Irish authorities had buried Silva's body the previous month without notifying them or offering them the chance to hold a memorial service for her. On the 2nd August 2018 Sylva Tukula died. Sylva was a dear friend of the LGBT+ community in Galway city and, in particular, of AMACH! LGBT+ Galway and our resource centre, [Teach  Due to Sylva’s status as an International Protection Applicant in Ireland, the Department of Justice and Equality were obligated to investigate the circumstances of her death, to liaise with friends and fellow residents of the Direct Provision centre where she lived, and to make  burial arrangements. Close friends and colleagues of Sylva were assured by both national and local State representatives that we would be notified once arrangements were made. Sadly, we were recently informed that our dear friend was buried by the State at the beginning of May. Members of our community and, especially those close to Sylva, were devastated to hear of her burial with no-one close to her present. We had the understanding that we would be made aware of the funeral arrangements in advance so that our community, Sylva’s Galway family, could be a part of this service, and to ensure that her life was celebrated on the day of her burial. We continually checked with Government representatives for updates, while receiving no new information regarding any arrangements. The fact that Sylva’s burial occurred in the absence of a ceremony, and without attendance, is deeply offensive to everyone close to Sylva, particularly members of the LGBT+ community who lived in the Great Western, who knew her from the Eglinton Direct Provision centres in Galway City and those that met her throughout her life in Galway. This abhorrent news has left many in shock, with those in the direct provision sites feeling that they will be buried alone thousands of miles away from people they grew up with by the Irish State. Anyone who has had a loved one pass away would empathise with how this has affected those that knew her, and how devastating this act would feel. We are left with more questions than answers as to how this has been allowed to occur. Our dear friend Sylva was failed by the system in which she was entrapped, in many ways; yet at all times she bore these failings with grace, with dignity and with a warm smile. We strongly request this matter be investigated both to the fullest possible extent and in a timely manner, to establish how this system failed our friend Sylva this last, final time. In her honour we must ensure that this tragic outcome does not occur again, to anyone. AMACH! LGBT+ intend to work with those who knew and loved Sylva to mark her burial and celebrate her life. We would ask that media respect the privacy of all those affected by this news. Anyone who wishes to be a part of this event is encouraged to contact us""",2018.0,Gaillimh,0,"['sylva', 'was', 'an', 'asylum', 'seeker', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'detained', 'for', 'a', 'year', 'she',

Ashley Sherman,25.0,2014-10-27,Indiana,United States of America,39.76845,-86.156212,violence,shot,"Ashley's body was discovered by a police officer making a traffic stop in the area. She had been shot in the head. The body of Ashley (nee Tajshon) Sherman was discovered on the east side of Indianapolis on Sunday evening by a police officer who was making a traffic stop in the area. Ashley was a black trans woman who identified as female according to family members, and called herself Ashley according to co-workers. She had been the victim of numerous cases of harassment and abuse, and was a runaway at age 12. Police later updated their reports with the information that Ashley had been shot in the head. Neighbors in the Tudor Park Condominiums report hearing a shot around midnight that evening.  Initial coverage of Ashley Sherman’s death was complicated by the police and local media mis-gendering her as male after initially identifying her as female, and mis-naming her as her birth name instead of her chosen name. Misreporting trans women’s murders by mis-gendering has been linked to problems with tracking murders of trans women nationwide and hampered police investigations of those murders. Mis-naming murder victims contributes to lack of police evidence as they attempt to speak to friends who might have known the victim by their chosen name but not their birth name.

Roxsana Hernández Rodriguez,33.0,2018-05-13,New Mexico,United States of America,35.188133,-107.894427,custodial,died in custody,"Roxsana died from dehydration 9 days after being taken into custody by US Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE).She was a refugee from Honduras, and had fled to the USA after threats from MS-13. Hernández Rodriguez had told Buzzfeed, months before her death, ""she was walking home when MS-13 gang members started screaming 'We don't want you in this neighborhood, you fucking faggot' at her before gang-raping her.""  ""Four of them raped me and as a result I got HIV,"" Hernandez told BuzzFeed News. ""Trans people in my neighborhood are killed and chopped into pieces, then dumped inside potato bags.""She was being held at the privately run Cibola Correctional Facility in Milan, New Mexico. An inquest found that her death occurred after medical treatment was withheld, and that she was most likely beaten while in ICE custody. The private prison facility at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico is operated by CoreCivic, the second-largest private prison company in the U.S. CoreCivic, co-founded by a former GOP chairman, operates more than 65 facilities and has come under fire for poor staffing and extensive lobbying efforts.  ""There she developed severe diarrhea and vomiting over the course of several days,"" the autopsy states, ""and finally was emergently hospitalized, then transported to Lovelace Medical Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she remained critically ill until her death.""  ""According to observations of other detainees who were with Ms. Hernández Rodriguez, the diarrhea and vomiting episodes persisted over multiple days with no medical evaluation or treatment, until she was gravely ill,"" forensic pathologist Kris Sperry wrote.  The autopsy ""also found evidence of physical abuse, with 'deep bruising' on her hands and abdomen, evidence of blunt-force trauma 'indicative of blows, and/or kicks, and possible strikes with blunt object.' An accompanying diagram illustrated long, thin bruises along Hernández Rodriguez’s back and sides, as well as extensive hemorrhaging on Hernández Rodriguez’s right and left wrists, which Dr. Sperry found were 'typical of handcuff injuries.'""It has been repeatedly reported that asylum seekers at the border are held in freezing holding cells (often referred to as ""hieleras"") for days. Cibola is a facility for male inmates, which also suggests abusive behaviour by the authorities. ""Paired with the abuse we know transgender people regularly suffer in ICE detention, the death of Ms. Hernández sends the message that transgender people are disposable and do not deserve dignity, safety, or even life,"" said Isa Noyola, Deputy Director at Transgender Law Center.  ""It is alarming that transgender communities continue to face transphobic violence outside and inside of detention walls,"" says Flor Bermudez, Legal Director at Transgender Law Center. ""This is why TLC's Trans Immigrant Defense Effort (TIDE) has organized to demand the liberation of transgender women from detention and the end of all detention and deportations. ICE has shown time and again it is incapable of protecting transgender women in detention. Transgender people should not be detained by ICE, at all.""  ""We have been demanding the release of our trans communities detained in ICE detention centers because of rampant physical and brutal treatment from guards and other detainees,"" said Jorge Gutiérrez, Executive Director of Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement.  ""At a time when we are grieving the murders of transgender women of color, and the murder of 20 year-old Claudia Patricia Gómez Gonzalez by Border Patrol at the Texas-Mexico border, it is unconscionable that a transgender woman would die in the hands of ICE at the Cibola trans pod in immigration detention. The community, now more than ever, needs to organize to protect our most vulnerable, in particular transgender immigrant women who are surrounded by violence on a daily basis,"" added Anandrea Molina, President of Organización Latina de Trans en Texas.  Transgender immigrants often seek asylum, withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture because of violence, rape and torture they have experienced in their countries of origin due to their gender identity or expression. However, once inside the United States, transgender immigrants may often face similar risks, as well as criminalization, as they are targeted and harassed by police or held in detention where they experience violence, discrimination, and an inability to access to medical care, all of which may lead to dire consequences.Subsequently it emerged that ICE had illegally deleted surveillance footage and other evidence. Phoenix (AZ) - The Transgender Law Center (TLC) organization filed a lawsuit on Wednesday for the alleged removal of a surveillance video and other evidence on the case of the undocumented transgender Roxsana Hernández Rodríguez , who died in ICE custody at a facility in New Mexico detention . The 33-year-old Honduran died nine days after being transferred to a unit dedicated to transgender women at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico, which is operated by CoreCivic, the country's second largest private prison company. Anna Castro, a spokesman for Transgender Law Center (TLC), told Efe that the lawsuit is against CoreCivic, ""and not only for the video, but for all the evidence that may have a connection with Roxsana during the time she remained in Cibola."" The organization and lawyers say that, by federal rule, ICE must preserve material that can serve as evidence, including electronic recordings.",2018.0,Milan,0,"['roxsana', 'died', 'from',

Marquiisha Lawrence,28.0,2021-11-04,South Carolina,United States of America,34.8788682,-82.4046488,violence,shot,"Marquiisha was shot in her home, possibly following an altercation with ""one or more individuals"". 28-year-old Black trans woman Marquiisha Lawrence of Greenville, South Carolina is the most recently reported victim of fatal violence terrorizing the trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming community in the United States. She died in her family home on Friday, November 5 where family members discovered her body at approximately 4:45 PM. Police reports indicate that she had multiple gunshot wounds. An autopsy was scheduled for the weekend. “Marquiisha Lawrence was found dead inside her residence located at 15 Loop Street in Greenville by family members. It appears that she was involved in an altercation with one or more individuals.” Marquiisha grew up in South Carolina where she graduated high school and studied cosmetology in nearby Spartanburg. She supported herself by working as a cook, a residential aid, and as a dancer. Marquiisha’s family held a balloon release for her on Sunday. Final arrangements are pending. As is the investigation. Marquiisha is the forty-fifth trans, nonbinary or gender nonconforming person reported killed in 2021. Forty of these neighbors have been BIPOC. 30 of these victims were under the age of 30. That we know of, as many deaths go unreported or unacknowledged. 2021 is now the most violent year on record for our trans neighbors in the United States, surpassing the previous total of 44 deaths in 2020.Dacorey Dashawn Massey, 17, was subsequently charged with her murder.Marquiisha's ",2021.0,Sans Souci,1,"['marquiisha', 'was', 'shot', 'in', 'her', 'home', 'possibly', 'following', 'an', 'altercation', 'with', 'one', 'or', 'more', 'individuals', '28', 'year', 'old', 'black', 'trans', 'woman', 'marquiisha', 'lawrence', 'of', 'greenville', 'south', 'carolina', 'is', 'the', 'most', 'recently', 'reported', 'victim', 'of', 'fatal', 'violence', 'terrorizing', 'the', 'trans', 'non', 'binary', 'and', 'gender', 'nonconforming', 'community', 'in', 'the', 'united', 'states', 'she', 'died', 'in', 'her', 'family', 'home', 'on', 'friday', 'november', '5', 'where', 'family', 'members', 'discovered', 'her', 'body', 'at', 'approximately', '4', '45', 'pm', 'police', 'reports', 'indicate', 'that', 'she', 'had', 'multiple', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'an', 'autopsy', 'was', 'scheduled', 'for', 'the', 'weekend', 'marquiisha', 'lawrence', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'inside', 'her', 'residence', 'located', 'at', '15', 'loop', 'street', 'in', 'greenville', 'by', 'family', 'members', 'it', 'appears', 'that', 'she', 'was', 'involved', 'in', 'an', 'altercation', 'with', 'one', 'or', 'more', 'individuals', 'marquiisha', 'grew', 'up', 'in', 'south', 'carolina', 'where', 'she', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'and', 'studied', 'cosmetology', 'in', 'nearby', 'spartanburg', 'she', 'supported', 'herself', 'by', 'working', 'as', 'a', 'cook', 'a', 'residential', 'aid', 'and', 'as', 'a', 'dancer', 'marquiisha', 's', 'family', 'held', 'a', 'balloon', 'release', 'for', 'her', 'on', 'sunday', 'final', 'arrangements', 'are', 'pending', 'as', 'is', 'the', 'investigation', 'marquiisha', 'is', 'the', 'forty', 'fifth', 'trans', 'nonbinary', 'or', 'gender', 'nonconforming', 'person', 'reported', 'killed', 'in', '2021', 'forty', 'of', 'these', 'neighbors', 'have', 'been', 'bipoc', '30', 'of', 'these', 'victims', 'were', 'under', 'the', 'age', 'of', '30', 'that', 'we', 'know', 'of', 'as', 'many', 'deaths', 'go', 'unreported', 'or', 'unacknowledged', '2021', 'is', 'now', 'the', 'most', 'violent', 'year', 'on', 'record', 'for', 'our', 'trans', 'neighbors', 'in', 'the', 'united', 'states', 'surpassing', 'the', 'previous', 'total', 'of', '44', 'deaths', 'in', '2020', 'dacorey', 'dashawn', 'massey', '17', 'was', 'subsequently', 'charged', 'with', 'her', 'murder', ""marquiisha's""]",marquiisha wa shot in her home possibly following an altercation with one or more individual 28 year old black trans woman marquiisha lawrence of greenville south carolina is the most recently reported victim of fatal violence terrorizing the trans non binary and gender nonconforming community in the united state she died in her family home on friday november 5 where family member discovered her body at approximately 4 45 pm police report indicate that she had multiple gunshot wound an autopsy wa scheduled for the weekend marquiisha lawrence wa found dead inside her residence located at 15 loop street in greenville by family member it appears that she wa involved in an altercation with one or more individual marquiisha grew up in south carolina where she graduated high school and studied cosmetology in nearby spartanburg she supported herself by working a a cook a residential aid and a a dancer marquiisha s family held a balloon release for her on sunday final arrangement are pending a is the investigation marquiisha is the forty fifth trans nonbinary or gender nonconforming person reported killed in 2021 forty of these neighbor have been bipoc 30 of these victim were under the age of 30 that we know of a many death go unreported or unacknowledged 2021 is now the most violent year on record for our trans neighbor in the united state surpassing the previous total of 44 death in 2020 dacorey dashawn massey 17 wa subsequently charged with her murder marquiisha's

She died from her injuries after being unable to access medical assistance.Five officers - including the security commissioner of the Municipality of Casimiro Castillo - were arrested and charged with the crimes of enforced disappearance, abuse of authority and qualified homicide. On August 26, a new hate crime was registered in Jalisco. This is the case of Britani Jaqueline, a trans woman beaten to death by police officers from the municipality of Casimiro Castillo.  According to LGBT + organizations and local press, both the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Municipal Police made her transfeminicide invisible. Both institutions avoided reporting that the victim was a trans woman. They even used their deadname and referred to Britani with masculine pronouns.  The hate crime against Britani Jaqueline occurred after municipal police from Casimiro Castillo, Jalisco, arrested her for an alleged robbery. According to local media, Letra Fría, the municipal police did not fill out the detention protocol and beat Britani ""brutally"". Later, upon leaving the separations, the victim required urgent medical assistance. However, ""she could not be transferred"", and died as a result of the beatings.  The aforementioned media indicated that the Jalisco Prosecutor's Office has already linked five people - the security commissioner of the Municipality of Casimiro Castillo and four municipal policemen - to the process for the hate crime against Britani Jaqueline.

Hanar,28.0,2022-02-06,Kordestan,Islamic Republic of Iran,35.5168281,46.1608599,suicide,suicide,"Hanar died by suicide. MARIWAN, Iran - It was the early hours of February 6, when 28-year-old Sara, a transgender woman from the city of Mariwan in Iran’s western Kurdistan province called her friend Hanar to check up on her. Hanar’s brother answered the phone, telling Sara that Hanar had done what she had said she would do for a long time. She had taken her life.   Screams filled the Mariwan graveyard the next morning as friends and family stood over the grave of Hanar, who was named [deadname] at birth, but decided to go by the name Hanar to better reflect the gender she identified as. It was also the nickname her friends, also transgender, referred to her as.   Sara was the first of the friendship group to find out that Hanar had committed suicide earlier that morning. She wanted to check up on Hanar because she had already expressed her suicidal thoughts to Sara on several occasions.   “She would always tell me about her pain, she did not like men’s clothes and did not want to act like a man, but we could not come out in public because the city is very small,” Sara told Rudaw English, crying over the death of her friend. “She wanted to undergo surgery, but when she asked a religious cleric last year, he told her that the surgery is forbidden in Sunni Islam, and she could not even tell her family about her problems.”  Sara was evidently shaken up as she recalled the amount of times Hanar had asked her to commit suicide together.  “She was talking about suicide more during the past few months. She told me ‘if you dare, let us commit suicide together and get out of this pain’, but nothing I told her seemed to have any effect,” Sara added.  At the end of their last encounter on February 5, Sara found it unusual how tightly Hanar had hugged her before leaving. “At around 3 am I gave her a call, but her brother picked up and said she had killed herself and her body was at the hospital,” she said, and just like that, another member of the LGBT+ community had fallen victim to the deeply entrenched cultural and traditional norms of Middle Eastern society.  Despite the Iranian government subsidizing sex reassignment surgeries for transgender people, endorsed by a decree from Iran’s former top Shiite religious authority Grand Ayatollah Khomeini, the process still requires the consent of the person’s family and the approval of specialized physicians.  The decree, however, is not implemented in the Sunni majority areas, mainly located in the predominantly Kurdish-populated western part of the country.

called her friend hanar to check up on her hanar s brother answered the phone telling sara that hanar had done what she had said she would do for a long time she had taken her life scream filled the mariwan graveyard the next morning a friend and family stood over the grave of hanar who wa named deadname at birth but decided to go by the name hanar to better reflect the gender she identified a it wa also the nickname her friend also transgender referred to her a sara wa the first of the friendship group to find out that hanar had committed suicide earlier that morning she wanted to check up on hanar because she had already expressed her suicidal thought to sara on several occasion she would always tell me about her pain she did not like men s clothes and did not want to act like a man but we could not come out in public because the city is very small sara told rudaw english cry over the death of her friend she wanted to undergo surgery but when she asked a religious cleric last year he told her that the surgery is forbidden in sunni islam and she could not even tell her family about her problem sara wa evidently shaken up a she recalled the amount of time hanar had asked her to commit suicide together she wa talking about suicide more during the past few month she told me if you dare let u commit suicide together and get out of this pain but nothing i told her seemed to have any effect sara added at the end of their last encounter on february 5 sara found it unusual how tightly hanar had hugged her before leaving at around 3 am i gave her a call but her brother picked up and said she had killed herself and her body wa at the hospital she said and just like that another member of the lgbt community had fallen victim to the deeply entrenched cultural and traditional norm of middle eastern society despite the iranian government subsidizing sex reassignment surgery for transgender people endorsed by a decree from iran s former top shiite religious authority grand

Her killer then got back into the car and drove away. HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Police are searching for two people who were with a transgender woman when she was shot and killed in an east Houston neighborhood overnight -- including the gunman.  The shooting happened very quickly, in just 10 seconds, according to Houston police detectives.  The victim was shot in the back in the middle of Wood Shadows Drive near the East Freeway around 1:45 a.m. Friday, police said.  She was pronounced dead at the scene.  Detectives said the victim was driving her car -- a four-door maroon Chrysler 200 -- with two other people also inside.  Police said the woman stopped the car on Centerwood Drive at Wood Shadows Drive, and she and a man got out.  That's when the suspect fired one shot from behind before getting back in the car and taking off, according to HPD.  ""Our victim stepped out of the vehicle, was driving another person - it's hard to say - they were dressed in black, possibly a male,"" Det. Sgt. Thomas Simmons said. ""They got out of the backseat. There was one gunshot fired. The victim fell. The suspect returned to the back of the vehicle. The vehicle left.""  Police said the two suspects abandoned the victim's car two blocks away on a dead-end street.  Investigators believe the shooting has no connection to the surrounding homes in the neighborhood.  They're reviewing surveillance video, hoping to get a better look at exactly what happened.  The victim's car was towed away from the scene and is being processed. Marisela Castro, 39, was born in Juticalpa, Olancho in Honduras. She spent most of her life in North Carolina where she attended Riverside High School, moved to Houston several years ago to be close to her sister and her nieces and nephews, She was a supporter of St. Jude’s Hospital and a fan of Bad Bunny. Marisela worked in the construction trades.  Friends shared the she often sang songs by the Mexican American artist “Marisela,” her namesake. She kept up a bright and sunny demeanor despite the discrimination she faced. Her friend  Jorge Luis Lizardo knows the violence she faced and that it may have cost her life.  She had no enemies, according to Lizardo, who suspects that her death was the result of another senseless hate crime.  “She was always so happy, but you know that all across the U.S. there are many that don’t like transgender people, and this is not the first time this has happened,” he said.

Islan was knocked to the ground and died of her injuries some days later in hospital. Saturday just after midnight, Islan Nettles, a 21-year-old fashion design student was walking down 8th Avenue near West 147th Street right in front of a police precinct, when a group of men started saying some very mean things. ""They were called f****, they were called he-she's, she males, things of that nature,"" her mother Delores Nettles said. Police say one of the men was 20-year-old Paris Wilson, who they say punched Nettles, knocked her down, and wouldn't stop. She was taken to Harlem Hospital with severe head trauma where she slipped into a coma and was pronounced brain dead Tuesday. ~ ABC Local A spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner’s office, Ellen Borakove, said on Friday that the death had been ruled a homicide and the cause was “blunt force trauma.”In April 2016 James Dixon, 25, was sentenced to 12 years on charges of second-degree manslaughter and first-degree assault. While Ms. Nettles was still in a coma, Mr. Dixon turned himself in to the police. In written and videotaped statements, he told detectives that he had started flirting with Ms. Nettles, unaware she was transgender, after meeting her and her two friends on the street. He said he became enraged and attacked her when his friends began mocking him for trying to pick up a transgender woman. “I just didn’t want to be fooled,” he said in a videotaped statement. The victim’s mother, Delores Nettles, told the court she believed 12 years was too light a sentence, given the brutal beating her daughter took. “He can go home after those 12 years and see his family,” she said in tears. “It’s not fair.” Turning to Mr. Dixon, she said: “How can you sleep at night? How can you rest? I can’t rest.” Mr. Dixon showed no emotion. He declined to make a statement before Justice Daniel P. Conviser pronounced the sentence, which had been negotiated with the judge on the eve of the trial in return for a guilty plea. Prosecutors objected to the deal; they had sought a sentence of at least 17 years.",2013.0,New York City,1,"['islan', 'and', 'two', 'other', 'trans', 'people', 'were', 'attacked', 'after', 'a',

She had been shot in the back of the head.She was taken to hospital but died a few hours later. To her family, Crystal was known by a few names. Because, as a child, she had a bump on her face, they called her Bumpkis, Bumpy, and then Bumpers. But mostly they called her Ms. Crystal. Now and then the family referred to her by her birth name, or as many in the trans community call it, her dead name. Deadnaming is the act of referring to a trans person by their birth name instead of their chosen name. Some of the family members also had an issue using Crystal's preferred pronouns. However, they spoke highly and honestly of her. You could see how fresh this trauma was on all of the family's faces. Any time Crystal's sister spoke of her, she would fight back tears.

Isabella Soares (Isabella Pedrozo),22.0,2020-08-23,Rio Grande do Sul,Brazil,-30.1374293,-51.2211218,violence,shot,"Isabella was shot dead in a motel room in what appears to have been a targetted execution aimed not at her, but at the man she was with. She died at the scene. This week started in a mood of mourning for the LGBTI community in Curitiba. Isabella Soares, 22 years old, was murdered in the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, in a crime that seems to have been aimed at her companion. Isabella has lived in Canoas since the beginning of the year and may have been killed by mistake.  According to the police, the man who was in the room with her was the target of a  gang of three men who broke into the San Diego motel in the Ipanema neighborhood and ordered that the door be opened. When this did not happen they fired several shots with a 9mm pistol through a window, hitting Isabella three times. She died on the spot. The crime occurred at around 11 pm on Sunday.  The 24-year-old who was with her has a criminal record. He hid in the bathroom and was the one who called the Military Brigade after the criminals left the place. The 4th Homicide Police Station in Porto Alegre (4th DPHPP) of the Civil Police investigates the murder. Apparently, in a brief internet search, executions inside motels in Rio Grande do Sul are common.  It is worth praising the police of Rio Grande do Sul and the Rio Grande do Sul press that did not treat the death of the young trans in a sensationalist way, always referring to her as a woman, without revealing her transsexuality.Isabella's Note that some sources name her as Isabella Pedrozo.",2020.0,Porto Alegre,1,"['isabella', 'was', 'shot', 'dead', 'in', 'a', 'motel', 'room', 'in', 'what', 'appears', 'to', 'have', 'been', 'a', 'targetted', 'execution', 'aimed', 'not', 'at', 'her', 'but', 'at', 'the', 'man', 'she', 'was', 'with', 'she', 'died', 'at', 'the', 'scene', 'this', 'week', 'started', 'in', 'a', 'mood', 'of', 'mourning', 'for', 'the', 'lgbti', 'community', 'in', 'curitiba', 'isabella', 'soares', '22', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'murdered', 'in', 'the', 'capital', 'of', 'rio', 'grande', 'do', 'sul', 'in', 'a', 'crime', 'that', 'seems', 'to', 'have', 'been', 'aimed', 'at', 'her', 'companion', 'isabella', 'has', 'lived', 'in', 'canoas', 'since', 'the', 'beginning', 'of', 'the', 'year', 'and', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'by', 'mistake', 'according', 'to', 'the', 'police', 'the', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'in', 'the', 'room', 'with', 'her', 'was', 'the', 'target', 'of', 'a', 'gang', 'of', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'broke', 'into', 'the', 'san', 'diego', 'motel', 'in', 'the', 'ipanema', 'neighborhood', 'and', 'ordered', 'that', 'the', 'door', 'be', 'opened', 'when', 'this', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'they', 'fired', 'several', 'shots', 'with', 'a', '9mm', 'pistol', 'through', 'a', 'window', 'hitting', 'isabella', 'three', 'times', 'she', 'died', 'on', 'the', 'spot', 'the', 'crime', 'occurred', 'at', 'around', '11', 'pm', 'on', 'sunday', 'the', '24', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'was', 'with', 'her', 'has', 'a', 'criminal', 'record', 'he', 'hid', 'in', 'the', 'bathroom', 'and', 'was', 'the', 'one', 'who', 'called', 'the', 'military', 'brigade', 'after', 'the', 'criminals', 'left', 'the', 'place', 'the', '4th', 'homicide', 'police', 'station', 'in', 'porto', 'alegre', '4th', 'dphpp', 'of', 'the', 'civil', 'police', 'investigates', 'the', 'murder', 'apparently', 'in', 'a', 'brief', 'internet', 'search', 'executions', 'inside', 'motels', 'in', 'rio', 'grande', 'do', 'sul', 'are', 'common', 'it', 'is', 'worth', 'praising', 'the', 'police', 'of', 'rio', 'grande', 'do', 'sul', 'and', 'the', 'rio', 'grande', 'do', 'sul', 'press', 'that', 'did', 'not', 'treat', 'the', 'death', 'of', 'the', 'young', 'trans', 'in', 'a', 'sensationalist', 'way', 'always', 'referring', 'to', 'her', 'as', 'a', 'woman', 'without', 'revealing', 'her', 'transsexuality', ""isabella's"", 'note', 'that', 'some', 'sources', 'name', 'her', 'as', 'isabella', 'pedrozo']",isabella wa shot dead in a motel room in what appears to have been a targetted execution aimed not at her but at the man she wa with she died at the scene this week started in a mood of mourning for the lgbti community in curitiba isabella soares 22 year old wa murdered in the capital of rio grande do sul in a crime that seems to have been aimed at her companion isabella ha lived in canoas since the beginning of the year and may have been killed by mistake according to the police the man who wa in the room with her wa the target of a gang of three men who broke into the san diego motel in the ipanema neighborhood and ordered that the door be opened when this did not happen they fired several shot with a 9mm pistol through a window hitting isabella three time she died on the spot the crime occurred at around 11 pm on sunday the 24 year old who wa with her ha a criminal record he hid in the bathroom and wa the one who called the military brigade after the criminal left the place the 4th homicide police station in porto alegre 4th dphpp of the civil police investigates the murder apparently in a brief internet search execution inside motel in rio grande do sul are common it is worth praising the police of rio grande do sul and the rio grande do sul press that did not treat the death of the young trans in a sensationalist way always referring to her a a woman without revealing her transsexuality isabella's note that some source name her a isabella pedrozo

Josie Berrios (aka Kendra Adams and Kimbella Rosé),28.0,2017-06-13,New York,United States of America,42.422372,-76.461572,violence,burned,"Josie’s burnt body was discovered inside a building at a construction site next to a can of petrol. Evidence, including surveillance video, led police to her boyfriend Michael Davis, 45.In 2018 Davis pleaded guilty to charges of second degree murder. On the day they buried Josie, those who loved her best bathed her casket in a cascade of color. They huddled together, dozens of her closest family and friends, wearing ponchos against the heavy rain, and tossed handfuls of multi-colored sugar on the wooden box. The colors swirled atop the water-slicked casket as family and friends traced hearts and messages in the residue.  A friend played the ukulele and sang ""Over the Rainbow."" The crowd joined in, singing young Dorothy Gale's song about longing for a happier place, about yearning in the face of reality.  In a word, Josie's mother said, it was beautiful.  No one word could describe the 28-year-old woman they buried that day in Greensprings Natural Cemetery, near Josie's home of Ithaca. Beautiful — certainly, in spirit most of all, those who knew Josie Berrios say. She was generous, compassionate, colorful, bigger-than-life. That casket? Josie's mother Judy said they wanted it ""decked out like the diva she was.""   Josie, they say, exuded light — a light extinguished by her murder June 13, 2017, at the hands of her boyfriend, Michael Davis. The man and their volatile relationship had unnerved Josie's family, and the violence she suffered at his hands is horrifyingly familiar: More than half — 55%, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — of all female homicide victims in the United States are killed by an intimate partner.Josie performed as a drag queen under the name Kimbella Rosé as part of the House of Merlot, a wine-themed drag house. Her stage name was as Kimbella Rosé. Though Josie was a woman, not a man dressing as a woman as many other performers were, performing gave her an opportunity to step outside the typical dress code of everyday life. On stage she could be bold, putting on extra makeup and dressing up in fun costumes.  She had solid plans, detailed dreams: to legally change her name to Kendra Adams and get her driver's license, then to apply for cosmetology school and become a licensed professional.  Something always seemed to get in the way.   She had no transportation to the Rochester cosmetology school, she fell behind in the paperwork, and there were constantly more immediate needs for the money she and Judy had set aside. ""(Transgender people) need opportunities,"" Maurer said, ""and in my mind, those opportunities are things many transgender people face barriers to: public employment, education, easy ability to obtain identity documents. It's not because of you and your identity; it's because of the conditions around you.""",2017.0,East Ithaca,1,"['josie', 's', 'burnt', 'body', 'was', 'discovered', 'inside', 'a', 'building', 'at',

In the images, it is possible to see that the car stops in an alley. Shortly thereafter, the driver turns off the vehicle and, just over a minute later, climbs out of the driver's door dragging a person by the hair. The victim is kicked and thrown against a wall, and the assailant then gets back in the car, starts the vehicle and drives away. Later, the vehicle returns and runs over the victim a second time.

Tatiana Gomes,28.0,2007-02-18,Apulia,Italy,41.275088,16.416259,violence,beaten,"Tatiana was beaten around the head with a stone while working on the street. Her killer then crushed her head between a car door and body. [Deadname] Gomes, also known as Tatiana, was of Brazilian origins. She was discovered by a jogger on the morning of Monday 19 February 2007, in the middle of a street on the outskirts of Trani, Italy. She had fatal blow to the temple — which police suspect could have been done by a stone — and then her head was slammed by a car door. The Court of Trani sentenced Romano Patrizio Lomolino, a 40-year-old suspect from Trani, to 30 years in prison after being convicted f the murder of [deadname] Gomes, which took place on February 18, 2007. His defender, Mario Malcangi, has already made it known that he will appeal the sentence. That night fourteen years ago Lomolino, together with another suspect, had taken from Gomes, under threat, a sum of money that the [victim] refused to pay: at that point Lomolino had lashed out causing her death. Lomolino had previously served a 10-year sentence for the robbery of the post office in Largo Petrarca, dating back to March 2007, which ended with the serious injury of a security guard. He was then sentenced to 9 years, for sexual harassment and robbery against a trans [person[ from Bisceglie. However, he was freed again at the beginning of November 2018 after the Court of Appeal had acquitted him.

Isabella Garzón Monsalve, a 23-year-old trans woman, was in Astorga Park, in the El Poblado neighborhood, with several friends after the massive mobilization for the rights of the LGBTIQ population that traveled through various streets of the city.  According to the report of the Security and Coexistence Information System, a [person] attacked them with a knife in a park in the Astorga neighborhood of El Poblado at around 8:00 on Sunday night.  Three people were injured, two of them with minor injuries and one with a more serious injury and although she was transferred to a clinic, unfortunately she died. Faced with this fact, the criminal investigation section is carrying out all the investigative tasks and the urgent acts have already been originated. The alleged aggressor is in preventative detention, but has not been arrested because the necessary warrant has not been issued.  Various organizations, including the Popular Trans Network, repudiated the attack and noted that with Isabella's killing, there have been 18 trans women murdered this year in Colombia.Two months later [a 27 year old trans woman was  for the crime: A 27-year-old trans woman was captured in an operation by the authorities in the La Floresta neighborhood (commune 12 of Medellín), as allegedly responsible for the aggravated homicide of another person from the LGBTIQ+ community. The homicide apparently took place during a fight that took place on July 4 in the vicinity of El Poblado park (commune 14), after the end of the LGBTIQ + pride march which took place that day in the city.

We received the news of the death of Ares Saturno and Soren Neres Denardi and we spent a few hours waiting for someone to tell us that it was just a mess and nothing had happened. That the two people were still alive. But no ... And it is with great sorrow that we write these lines that follow.  The non-binary trans couple was living in Praia Grande, São Paulo coast, with plans to move to Ceará. Apparently there was no time. Both committed suicide in a hotel in the city of Ribeirão Pires.  Ares Saturno , a former Brazilian who chose to be from São Paulo, worked writing for Canaltech Brasil and was a declared lover of corporal modifications. Soren Neres Denardi had just turned 31, was a student of Letters of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro - UFRJ and fought bravely in the institution so that the trans people were entitled to use the social name. The life expectancy of a trans person in Brazil is 35 years, half when we compare with the cis population.  Friends, friends and friends of the couple claim that it was suicide, both had history and, it seems, combined everything. In one of the messages shared on social networks, Soren says goodbye to a friend and says they are going to the next phase, "" and it's not in an organic body . "" In those words, they said they were satisfied with themselves, but tired and that the world of humans is unjust. Soren also complained on the social networks of their critical financial situation and asked for help.  The death of Ares and Soren is a tragedy echoed in everyday transphobia and hatred of the different. Happening exactly in the Trans Visibility Month  is symptomatic and should teach us something. It is a great warning for us to do something - as long as there is time - for dissenting people to have a desire and a right to live. Our country has become a (more) suffocating and (more) unbearable place for trans people in its broadest spectrum of gender diversity. It is a painful alert, but it is once again being rubbed in the face of society with its system of necropoly. It is urgent that something is done.  May Ares and Soren rest in peace. Our condolences to friends, friends and friends of both. We are very sorry.

Ja’leyah-Jamar,28.0,2019-09-13,Kansas,United States of America,39.1127,-94.626804,violence,shot,"Ja’leyah-Jamar was shot. Police have released a photo of a suspect being sought in connection with their murder. The 19th reported murder of a transgender American this year took place Friday in Kansas City, Kan., according to local activists. Kansas City police and local media have identified the victim, who was shot to death, as a 20-something man and have not released a name, but friends, relatives, and activists have posted on social media that she was a trans woman named Ja’leyah-Jamar. Adriana Sanders, the victim’s cousin, posted the following on Facebook: “Ja’leyah-Jamar didn’t ask for this life... No one can control WHO they love God made us to live and love and to grow... It’s not our fault as a Transgender woman or a homosexual man to want to live a normal life...wanting to be in love have a family build your own legacy and because a Man could not accept who [they] [were] as [themself] and individual he felt the need to take my cousin’s life.” “Another Black trans woman was killed in Kansas City this weekend!” activist Merrique Jenson posted on Facebook. “Kansas City is one of the epicenters of violence towards trans women of color, particularly Black trans women, in this country! I learned of the information yesterday and have checked in with some of the trans women who knew her directly. While she is still being misgendered and misidentified by most KC media outlets, community advocates have already begun to share updates as we learn more. I encourage agencies with social, political and financial power to do something about this.” Trans woman Brooklyn Lindsey was murdered across the state line in Kansas City, Mo., in June. Of the 19 transgender Americans reported murdered this year, 18 have been black women, including Ja’leyah-Jamar. Police have released a photo of a man being sought in connection with the Friday murder, along with two photos of his car, The Kansas City Star reports.Subsequently relatives stated that Jamar was a gender nonconforming gay man rather than a trans woman.

"Hilary Medina (""Cristin"")",22.0,2020-01-18,Huila,Colombia,2.9243817,-75.2930971,violence,shot,"Hilary was one of two people shot by two men on a motorcycle on the evening of Saturday 18th January. Her colleague survived but Hilary died in hospital. At almost 10:00 pm on last Saturday January 18, Hilary Medina, a 22-year-old trans woman, was with another young woman from the LGBTI community on the corner of a drugstore located [at the intersection of carrera 2 with calle 6] in the center of the city of Neiva (Huila). Everything seemed calm until two subjects who were riding a motorcycle arrived at the scene and one of them, without a word, fired indiscriminately against the two women. The young women tried to run to save their life. Hilary dodged some bullets, ran a few meters and then collapsed. According to the authorities, she received two impacts in her back. The brutal attack was captured by security cameras in the area. Her partner, meanwhile, was injured in the shoulder and is currently recovering in hospital.Hilary had transitioned 5 years earlier and had a good relationship with her mother Claudia. Like far too many other trans women in Latin America, she had been forced into making a living as a sex worker. ""The discrimination we suffered was great. My daughter had a job of prostitution because she could never go to a school where she was received as the woman she felt herself to be. She could never access a decent job where they respected her [identity]. That's why many from them they choose that path, not because they want to, but because it is their turn; because there are no opportunities of any kind,"" Claudia said. “The day she left, I told her daughter very carefully; because you really know that they are exposed to many things on the street and more in that trade. It is difficult for a mother to know that her daughter was murdered without knowing why, I do not really understand what happened, ”said her mother as tears moisten her face. “My daughter's dream was to celebrate my birthday and buy me a house so I wouldn't continue paying rent. I just want to tell you something, never forget that transsexual, gay, lesbian or whatever people, are daughters, sisters, granddaughters because they have a family, and today it hurts us what they did to my daughter, because it was I who I had in my gut and I never cared what her sexual condition was, so I accepted it, ”concludes Claudia Jaramillo.",2020.0,Neiva,1,"['hilary', 'was', 'one',

Her body was found by residents the following morning. A [trans woman] was stabbed to death in the early hours of Wednesday (30), in São José da Laje, in the Zona da Mata de Alagoas. Three men were arrested, a minor was apprehended but another man who also participated in the crime was not found.  According to information gathered by the city's Civil Police, the victim's registration name was [deadname] Alves da Silva, known as [deadnickname]. The investigation determined that she was at a party with the suspects, when at one point they stole about R $ 300 from the victim. She reacted and was stabbed in the neck and ribs.  Edberg Oliveira, a delegate of the São José da Laje and Ibateguara Police Station, informed the G1 report that shortly after stealing from the victim one man and the minor had left and the other three suspects stayed at the party. The victim noticed the theft, identified the suspects and went to confront them.  ""The two suspects who stole from the victim were gone and the three men stayed. They had a disagreement with the victim and killed her. Then they hid her corpse in a wooded area,"" said the deputy. Police said the murder was unrelated to transphobia because the suspects' aim was to rob from the victim.

On the morning of this Wednesday (5/20), a team from the Technical Police Department of Itabuna was called in to proceed with expertise and removal of the body of a transvestite, brutally murdered on the margins of BR-101, in the vicinity of Posto Atalaia, in Itabuna. The body still had a condom on the genital area, indicating that the victim may have been murdered during sexual intercourse. The Military Police isolated the crime area until the arrival of the Technical Police, coordinated by the expert Messias Malheiros. The victim has not yet been identified. However, about 50m from where the body was, the police found a helmet numbered 273, a pouch containing tools, a cell phone and personal documents in the name of [deadname] de Souza. The victim's body had a firearm shot in the neck area, and according to experts, it may have been dragged under a vehicle, perhaps to make it appear to be a hit and run. The Civil Police are investigating the case. This is the second crime of homicide against a [trans woman] in Itabuna this month. The police are investigating the connection between the two crimes.

Bianca,32.0,2017-09-29,Gelderland,Netherlands,51.97973,5.9124,violence,stabbed,"Bianca was a sex worker, and had rented a house in Arnhem to work from. On her first day there she was stabbed over twenty times by her first customer (and potentially one or more accomplices). The house was reported to be full of bloodstains, and police have apprehended one suspect. I do not know whether to vomit, scream or cry. For the murder, with all the gruesome details of blood traces on walls and paving stones, to the tone and word choice of this article that this woman is deprived of every dignity, respect, humanity and identity.  Bianca, dear editorial of the Gelderlander, was a woman who had probably been victim of her entire life for people who did not take it as full?—?not as a woman and not as a person. Bianca was not a man who looked utterly like a woman, she was a woman, perhaps more aware of her femininity than most women ever will be, and paid the highest possible price with her death. What she has between her legs does not appeal to a reader. This makes the editors guilty of sexual objectification.  The reason why so many female trans persons work in prostitution is equally painful: they are not accepted for any other profession. Not even in the Netherlands.

The date of her identification is used for this report in order that she might be remembered at TDoR 2019 this November. ""After more than three years, DNA confirmed the human remains from 2016 Macon homicide case are that of a transgender woman. DNA test results recently obtained by the Bibb County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the match. ""Bibb County Coroner Leon Jones told The Telegraph on Friday the remains are Dymun Dupree, originally identified by Warner Robins police as [deadname]. ""Dupree had been missing for two weeks on April 18, 2016, when the Warner Robins Police Department sent out a news release asking for the public’s help finding her. ""The 26-year-old was last seen leaving home, on the north side of Warner Robins, just before midnight April 2. Four days later, Victoria Clark reported her cousin missing. She told police Dupree said she was going to hang out with friends but did not say where or with whom. ""On May 12, more than a month later, a man mowing grass at a vacant lot on Feagin Road, off Ga. 247, made a gruesome discovery. Amid the kudzu, briers and overgrowth, he found a human skull and called 911. ""At the time, the sheriff’s department could only say that a person had been shot in the head. The sex and race of the victim were not apparent. Investigators visited Dupree’s mother, Frankie Allen, and took a cheek swab so that her DNA could be compared to the victim’s remains. In January 2017, DNA from the remains was sent to the Center for Human Identification at the University of North Texas. There, forensic scientists developed a DNA profile and compared it with DNA from Allen that was obtained using the swab.  “It’s just hard when you don’t know what to think,” Allen told The Telegraph in a May 2018 interview. The last time Allen saw Dupree, she was sitting on her porch reading the mail. The two told each other, “I love you.” Dupree enjoyed singing gospel music, her mom said. She ate cookies with milk daily, enjoyed drinking Coca-Cola Classic and smoking Newports in the morning.Dymun's ",2019.0,Warner Robins,1,"['dymun', 'went', 'missing', 'on', '2nd', 'april', '2016',

Investigators determined that she died from blunt force trauma to the head. It has emerged that a transgender person, whose body was found wrapped in a blanket in the Bornova district of Izmir, was killed as a result of being hit around the head by a hard object.  When bad smells began to emanate from the apartment of the transgender person who used the name 'Miras Günes', the residents of the building reported the situation to her relatives. She had not been heard from for a while and her relatives had reported her missing.Three suspects were subsequently arrested. In November 2021, Serdar Gülsoy was sentenced to life imprisonment (with a minimum term of 18 years) but the other two suspects were released. In the examination made by the police teams who came, it was determined that [deadname] had been hit on the head with a hard object and his face had become unrecognizable. Serdar Gülsoy (43), Turgay Türker (37) and Murat Inceçelik (29), who were arrested in connection with the incident. In the indictment prepared after the investigation, the prosecutor sentenced Serdar Gülsoy to life imprisonment and 18 years in prison on charges of 'deliberate murder', 'qualified theft', 'violation of the immunity of more than one residence at night' and 'chain abuse of another's bank or credit card'. and Murat Inceçelik on charges of 'deliberately assisting murder', 'qualified theft', 'violation of the immunity of more than one residence at night' and 'chain abuse of someone else's bank or credit card'.

From that moment on, I did what the accused Serdar said."" said. The accused Murat Inceçelik also did not accept the accusations against him. The court decided to release Murat Inceçelik and Turgay Türker on condition of judicial control by applying a ban on leaving the country, and to continue the detention of Serdar Gülsoy.

The clinic where the procedure was performed has been shut down while her death is investigated. Bogotá, Colombia.- A trans woman died after undergoing plastic surgery in a clinic north of Bogotá. Family members have denounced negligence on the part of the clinic.  Arelis Cabezas Sierra , a 38-year-old woman, died hours after a procedure around 4:00 pm last Thursday, January 20 of this year. "" She was my best friend, my little sister. I studied college with her, we watched class with her, we told each other everything, she was a very intelligent person, you could talk to her about anything, any topic."" said Daniel, Arelis's brother.  Arelis' relatives are demanding that the cause of death be investigated , as they maintain that there was negligence. ""I think there was a very obvious negligence here , because they did not have the medical teams available for resuscitation and there were no medical staff in charge with any authority. What's more, if the surgeon and the friend were there in the room, the one who should be resuscitating is the surgeon."", said Daniel.  According to the news outlet Noticias Caracol, he contacted the surgeon Yesid ""M"", who performed the procedure on the trans woman. The doctor assured that it was a planned and scheduled surgery within everything normal, and that all of the pertinent laboratory tests required to be able to operate on a patient had been performed.  The surgeon mentioned that the plastic surgery was performed under the proper protocols and explained that he is attentive to do what the justice determines and awaits the opinion of Legal Medicine.  However, the district entity affirmed that an administrative process had been initiated against the doctor and the surgery room had been closed. In addition to this, flaws were found in the infrastructure and staffing of the clinic. The opinion of Legal Medicine will be decisive in determining the cause of death of Arelis.",2022.0,Cota,0,"['arelis', 'died', 'several', 'hours', 'after', 'a', 'cosmetic', 'procedure', 'on',

The bullets, according to the paramedics' diagnosis, were embedded in her head: two in the left cheek and one more in the parietal area.

After police restrained her and put her in a spit hood during an altercation, she died in an ambulance en route to hospital, despite paramedics' attempt to save her. DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) — Dallas police said today they are investigating a death in custody that took place on May 26, 2022. Deputy Chief Terrance Rhodes with the DPD's Criminal Investigations Bureau said that [deadname] Hall, 47, died at Baylor Hospital after officers took her into custody. According to Rhodes, police received a 911 call at 12:45 p.m. from a business in the 12000 block of Garland Road. An employee told dispatchers that Hall was causing a disturbance inside the business and said he believed she was under the influence of drugs or alcohol due to her yelling and falling down. Four minutes later, at 12:49 p.m., two officers were assigned to the call. They arrived at 12:59 p.m. and located Hall outside of 11900 Garland Road. Police said Hall appeared to be in an ""altered mental state"" and did not respond to questions. Shortly after, at 1:04 p.m., Hall collapsed while speaking to crewmembers of Dallas Fire-Rescue Engine 49. She stood back up and began yelling at first responders before attempting to take off her clothing. The two police officers attempted to take her into custody, but she was not compliant and was taken to the ground and handcuffed. On the ground, Hall continued to scream at officers and other first responders while attempting to move. Two more officers then arrived to assist the others. At 1:15 p.m., DFR Engine 75 arrived on scene. Hall was placed on a stretcher and loaded onto the ambulance.

Afterwards his killers dragged his body up the street. A 20-year-old trans man had his body dragged down the street and was shot three times in the head last night (6) in the Pici neighborhood of Fortaleza (CE). Police believe the case is related to drug trafficking in the region, but do not rule out the possibility that the crime may be linked to homophobia. The case is under investigation by the 11th Police District of Fortaleza. Yuri Gabriel Castro Farias Praciano, the victim's social name, was approached by three men, tied to a pole and executed with three shots to the head. After being shot, the body was dragged a few meters from Rua Álvares Maciel, according to the SSPDS (Secretariat of Public Security and Social Defense). Police confirmed that the victim had tickets for drug trafficking. Witnesses who saw Praciano tied to the pole called Ciops (Integrated Security Operations Coordination) to report the case.

The school misgendered and deadnamed him, and told students not to use social media to express grief or pay tribute. A 12-year-old child who friends claim was bullied because he was transgender has tragically died after reportedly taking his own life. His death has left friends shocked and they have demanded better treatment for all young people in the LGBTQ+ community as well as action to prevent bullying.  The boy was a student at Radcliffe School and the headteacher sent a message on Sunday to parents informing them of the tragedy. But friends have been angered by the statement, which referred to the pupil using the female name he had shunned. They also said he had been bullied relentlessly by peers and called for more action to be taken to protect children from bullying. The Citizen has chosen not to name the student.  In a letter to the Citizen the students said: ""X was a student at the Radcliffe school in year 8, he was transgender, using the he/him pronoun. X had been bullied relentlessly by his peers, which played a factor in his death, however, the school has not recognised this as the result of bullying on their premises, and have outwardly tried to silence any and all claims of this.""  The letter also claims: ""Students have been told by the school that we are specifically not allowed to use social media to express grief or tribute to X, and due to this, many people have been silenced, especially when correcting the staff on X's proper identity. ""  Students claim they have been told that they are not allowed to use social media to express grief or pay tribute to the pupil. They also claimed that heads of houses had read out a scripted message on Monday, February 7, which used the student's former name and used she/her pronouns.

El Centro Psico Trans de Quito and Asociación Silueta X, members of Plataforma Nacional Revolución Trans and the Federación ecuatoriana de Organizaciones LGBT, make the following public knowledge:  This December 28, 2020, HJ Ramírez, better known as La Tigra, was found dead at the gate of her house, located in Lomas de la Florida II, Guayaquil. La Tigra as they affectionately called her, 46 years old, was dedicated to the craft of sewing in the sector and was known for her kindness, cordiality and good heart by the locals.  Early this Monday, HJ Ramírez received a visit from an individual at her home at approximately 01:00 am. According to footage from the security cameras of a local neighbor, the subject was there close to an hour before running desperately out of La Tigra's home. In the morning, a client who was going to pick up her sewing found her lying down and lifeless near the door. Her body was stiff and bruised, and according to criminology data from the autopsy performed, HJ Ramírez died of asphyxiation - presumably by the individual who visited her and then rushed out of her home. The National Police continues in investigations.  We call on the authorities, especially the State Attorney General's Office and the National Police, to investigate the present case, regardless of whether or not the complaint is filed by the next of kin. Although it is true, it is known that, in the face of violent deaths, not clarified or suspected of criminality, the complaint is ex officio by the Prosecutor's Office, members of the Police, they mentioned that without a complaint there would be no investigations. This was reported to us by neighbors in the sector. Likewise, we invite the new Ministry of Government to provide us with answers about this and other murders, violent deaths, not clarified or suspected of criminality. Likewise, we request the Ombudsman's Office to monitor the due process initiated by the Prosecutor's Office.

Alexander Blake VanDalsen,21.0,2021-02-09,Indiana,United States of America,40.3935819,-86.9070575,suicide,possible suicide,"Alexander was found dead after being missing for a week. The missing person for whom police were searching the past week has reportedly died, the Tippecanoe County Coroner's office confirmed after identifying a corpse found in Lafayette Tuesday afternoon.  Lafayette man Alex VanDalsen, 21, was deceased when found by police on the 2000-block of Breckenridge Street in Lafayette around 1 p.m. Tuesday, according to Lafayette Police Department logs.  Pride Lafayette, a group that advocates for LGBTQ people in Greater Lafayette, started a Facebook fundraiser in an effort to raise money for VanDalsen's funeral expenses on Wednesday. VanDalsen was a transgender man, according to his Facebook page.  The petition, which as of Wednesday evening had raised over $3,200 from nearly 100 people, can be found on Facebook on a page titled ""Alexander's Funeral Expenses.""  ""We did not know Alex, but we do know that no mother should ever have to bury a child,"" wrote Ashley Smith, the fundraiser's creator. ""He was someone's child, someone's sibling, someone's grandchild.""  Police have not said whether VanDalsen was found with any injuries. An autopsy is scheduled for Thursday, according to the coroner.Subsequently his death was ruled a suicide following an autopsy. However, his family dispute the verdict: On February 3, 2021, It was a cold Indiana evening with snow on the ground. Alex left home on foot before midnight without telling anyone where he was going.  He wouldn't be seen alive again. On February 9th, Alex was found dead. His death was ruled a suicide without any investigation. The family doesn't believe the suicide theory for the following reasons: Alex's hands weren't tested for gunpowder residue. The gun was found underneath his body and wasn't tested for fingerprints.  Alex was found 10 miles from his home. It was less than 20 degrees and he wasn't dressed for the weather. He also didn't take his car. So how did he get to the site where his body was found? Because of his asthma, the snow and low temperature, he didn't make the 10 mile walk.  There were no shell casings at the death scene. How was that possible?  There was no blood splatter at the scene. Jennifer VanDalsen (Alex's mother) believes someone picked Alex up, killed him and then dumped his body. However, she believes law enforcement refused to investigate the case seriously because Alex was transgender.  The family has asked law enforcement to answer their concerns about Alex's death. They haven't received any answers. Did Alex truly commit suicide or was he murdered?

Mickerlange François,28.0,2020-10-17,Ouest,Haiti,18.5128958,-72.2918008,violence,shot,"Mickerlange was shot inside a nightclub on the night of Saturday 17th October. He was a police officer, and his assailant allegedly knew that he was a trans man. Mickerlange François, a transgender policeman was shot dead in Pétion-Ville, in a nightclub on the evening of Saturday, October 17. Two days later police apprehended Obenson Saindor, 28, aboard a motorcycle while trying to get to Dame-Marie, Grand’Anse on the coast.  Due to the public and media apathy, and the prevalence of transphobia in society and Haitian law enforcement, we are just now learning about the murder of Officer François.  After the policeman’s death, investigators focused on the community and barraged LGBT+ Haitians with excessive questions about the victim, according to Midou Blonski (pseudonym), a leader of the Haitian advocacy group FACSDIS (Femme en Action contre la Stigmatisation et la Discrimination Sexuelle/Women Taking Action Against Sexual Stigmatization and Discrimination).According to the advocacy journalist Moïse Manoel, the motive may have been jealousy: The alleged murderer, 28-year-old Obenson Saindor, shot policeman Mickerlange François in a Pétionville nightclub on Oct. 17.  Passion and jealousy were motives, as the victim had engaged in a romantic relationship with the alleged murderer’s partner. The alleged murderer had already threatened Mickerlange’s life while telling him to stay away from his household. Unfortunately, the victim did not take these threats seriously.  The alleged murderer was apprehended with the victim’s police service weapon, a 9mm caliber revolver.  Obenson was also in possession of a second revolver, which investigators said could have been used to commit the crime.  The alleged murderer knew the policeman was a trans man. The fact that Mickerlange died because of his gender identity disgusts me.  In addition, for me, this affair illustrates the way women are treated in Haiti. They are not respected and are seen as objects. Consequently, one can kill a rival, even a trans man, as one pleases. Women are seen as property, for one’s exclusive benefit.  This homicide illustrates anew the negation of feminine desire and aspirations. Because she loved someone else, he must be killed—without reflecting on what isn’t working between the original couple. That’s the problem.  We remain in a patriarchal society where women’s desires are ignored. This mentality leads only to submission or death.",2020.0,Petionville,1,"['mickerlange', 'was', 'shot', 'inside', 'a', 'nightclub', 'on', 'the', 'night', 'of', 'saturday', '17th', 'october', 'he',

Leeze Lawrence,39.0,2021-06-11,Scotland,United Kingdom (Great Britain),56.1187003,-3.9747177,uncategorised,not reported,"Leeze was an equality advocate, journalist and producer. She was found dead by police on Friday 11th June after friends and family were unable to contact her. Tributes have been paid to equality activist and independence campaigner Leeze Lawrence, who has died. The 39-year-old was found by police on Friday after friends and family were unable to contact her.  Ms Lawrence, who lived in Stirling, was a key member of the LGBT group Out for Independence, acting as the group’s Convener. She was an equality advocate and actively campaigned for the equal rights of minorities, particularly the transgender community. She was also a journalist, working for the BBC and others as a producer and creating a number of works documenting the lives of transgender and gay people.  In a statement this morning, Out For Independence members described their convener as a “force of nature” and said they were “heartbroken”. Their statement read: “Out For Independence is heartbroken to announce the passing of our Convener, Leeze Lawrence. It has been a huge shock. We ask for people to respect her family's privacy at this time.  “Leeze was a force of nature — loud, fierce, supportive and committed. Her life has been the kind of whirlwind she was, and she brought her vast network of contacts and experiences to Out For Independence to help us make new connections, build better policies and build shared solidarity between groups.  “She was dedicated to learning, becoming a better ally, and a better activist. In the last few months of her life, she was learning from GRT communities and we were planning with them the best way we could support LGBTQ+ Travellers. We hope to be able to continue that work in her memory.  “We will miss the way she went from no-nonsense organising with an iron will to being incredibly compassionate and looking after people who were struggling with abuse and harassment. There's no one way to describe her, except to say it has been a privilege to know her, and we miss her.”A vigil for her was held on Tuesday 15th June.Leeze's Facebook and Twitter profiles are  and

"Bonaire Black (""Bonni"")",18.0,2020-12-31,Georgia,United States of America,33.7726604,-84.3865425,uncategorised,not reported,"Bonni was found lying under a blanket on the third floor of a parking garage.Atlanta police said there were no signs of foul play, but people who knew her claim that she was killed during an argument. Friends and transgender advocates said Bonaire “Bonnie” Black was trying to find employment and housing. She was found dead on Dec. 31.  With fistfuls of pink and blue balloons – the colors of the transgender flag – friends gathered outside a drop-in center last week to memorialize Bonaire “Bonnie” Black, a transgender teen living on the streets who was found dead on New Year’s Eve.  The death of Black, 19, is under investigation by the Fulton County Medical   Black was at least the fifth trans or gender non-conforming person to be killed or die under questionable circumstances in Georgia in 2020.  The body of Black, 19, was found on the third floor of the parking garage at the Georgian Terrace on Peachtree Street in Midtown, according to an incident report. An employee found her laying under a blanket with her fist clenched at about 2:30 p.m. on Dec. 31.  When a hotel manager and another employee couldn’t wake Black, they called police. A police report described the incident as a “natural death.” Officer Sharetia Thomas, the police officer who responded to the hotel’s call, wrote in an incident report that an employee of the medical examiner called to the scene “advised me there was no foul play.”  An investigator with the medical examiner’s office told Project Q Atlanta that an autopsy was performed but declined to discuss details of the investigation. It could be six weeks before a lab returns toxicology test results to the medical examiner’s office. Bonnie died just 7 days before her 19th birthday and was homeless at the time of her death. She was described by those who knew her as an artist, songwriter and rapper. “She loved doing her makeup and going out into the world making sure she looked her best,” Toni Bryce, a community health outreach worker with the National AIDS Education & Services for Minorities (NAESM), said during the event. “She was a young girl taken very soon,” she added.  Black was a client at Da Cribb, which NAESM operates, for more than two years, Bryce told Project Q. Staff at the facility last saw her on or about Dec. 28, she added.  Black was living on the streets at the time of her death and would sometimes sleep on Da Cribb’s porch, Bryce said.  “Every day we were open, she would come in and utilize the services we had,” she added.  Black was from Savannah and relocated to Atlanta at 17, according to trans activists. Bryce said she was trying to find a job and housing. But even facing difficult circumstances, Black still tried to help others in need.  “When she was trying to find housing, she was trying to help people. She was definitely always trying to help somebody else that was in her situation,” Bryce said.Bonnie's ",2020.0,Atlanta,0,"['bonni', 'was', 'found', 'lying', 'under', 'a', 'blanket', 'on', 'the',

It goes almost without saying that Ms. Faulkner’s death is one in a tragic continuum of black trans women who are victimized, brutalized, and murdered just for their very existence. It needs to be said, however, that Sherrell Faulkner’s life is worth specific recognition and celebration. In every way that her death is systematic, it is also deeply individual, and should be treated as such.    When we only see Sherrell Faulkner as one name in a much-too-long list of transgender victims, we dehumanize her in a means that is ideologically similar to her aggressor(s). For this reason, we won’t to re-iterate the specifics of her death, since too many pieces focus only on them (we have linked some of these throughout.) Instead, we want to take a moment to talk about the Southern context of her death, and most importantly, the specifics of her life, which deserves its own context and recognition.

Vanesa Campos,36.0,2018-08-17,Ile-de-France,France,48.87509,2.28692,violence,stabbed and shot,"Vanesa was killed in the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris on the night of 16th/17th August while trying to prevent a gang of men from robbing her client.She was found ""naked, stabbed, with a bleeding wound in the chest"". 7 to 8 men attacked her. This follows other previous attacks. It would probably be a gang of men who regularly assault sex workers and their clients to steal from them. This band phenomenon targeting female sex workers is currently developing throughout the Ile de France region. Those who try to organize themselves to defend themselves and chase them are then attacked separately.  Today we mourn this loss and feel as usual abandoned. The murders of trans women sex workers are not rare. This is a recurring phenomenon and we regularly try to alert public opinion and the authorities to this violence. Unfortunately as always, we find ourselves alone.  Why does the life of trans women migrant sex workers matter so little? Why are our deaths treated only as news? Why are journalists so ignorant or so disrespectful that they say ""a transvestite prostitute"" is dead and continue to begrudge me into death? Does not the life of a bitch count?  We have in us this strange impression that our dead do not arouse any emotion. For us, there is never national mourning. There is never an official commemoration. The political class remains silent. Once the sensationalist press articles are over, it's the return to silence, and we have to go back to work with fear, waiting to be next.Nine individuals were subsequently arrested in connection with her death. In January 2022 Mahmoud Kadri, 24, Karim Ibrahim, 29 and Aymen Dib, 25, went on trial for murder. Vanesa Campos, a 36-year-old trans [sex worker] was shot in the chest on the night of August 16-17, 2018 in the Boulogne forest, a place that is known for the presence of sex workers. To protect herself from the vandals, Vanesa Campos had hired a bodyguard. However this was not sufficient a measure against this gang since they arrived armed with tear gas canisters, a knife and an electric pistol. Days before, a firearm had been stolen from a policeman's vehicle while en he was with another sex worker and would be used to commit the crime. One of the shots fired fatally wounded Vanesa Campos. The prosecution considers Mahmoud Kadri, 24, to be the author of the fatal shot. Karim Ibrahim, 29, and Aymen Dib, 25, are also charged with participating; hitting and stabbing her, respectively.In late January 2022 Mahmoud Kadri and Karim Ibrahim were sentenced to 22 years in prison for her murder. Six other defendents were sentenced to between 3 and 6 years. French justice sentenced two Egyptians to 22 years in prison this Saturday for the 2018 death of Vanesa Campos, a trans-Peruvian sex worker, on the outskirts of Paris. The sentences pronounced by the Paris criminal chamber against Mahmoud Kadri and Karim Ibrahim , for ""homicide in an organized gang"", are higher than those requested by the prosecution, of 20 and 15 years. Six other defendants for the same act were sentenced to three to six years in prison.",2018.0,Levallois-Perret,1,"['vanesa', 'was', 'killed', 'in', 'the', 'bois', 'de', 'boulogne', 'park', 'in',

Jasmine Sierra,52.0,2016-01-22,California,United States of America,35.373405,-119.018911,violence,beaten,"Jasmine's body was found by police on 22nd January in an apartment on the 1000 block of Monterey Street.Her body showed signs of trauma and foul play is suspected. Whether the police found the body in Sierra's home or a neighbour's house is not known.Her friends said they had no idea she was killed until weeks later because her birth name was published in the media.  With details scant about Sierra’s death, transgender advocates like Jeriann Guzman, the executive director of the Solano Serenity Center and Kelli Busey, editor-in-chief of Planet Transgender have sought to humanize Sierra and draw awareness about her death. The Solano Serenity Center was among the first to list Sierra on its website among trans homicide victims who must be remembered this year.  “Piecing together her life like a crossword puzzle we are learning a little about her,’” says Busey in her Planet Transgender report. ""There’s a Tumblr post where the author postulates a police conspiracy to cover up her murder which local media conspicuously called ‘suspicious.'""  The Tumblr post to which Busey refers alleges mishandling of the investigation by local police. While the author of the post remains unnamed, the individual’s allegations were repeated at the same time as the Tumblr post went live by two other trans people on Facebook (in comments now marked private) by individuals who claim to be friends of Sierra. (The author of the Tumblr post has not responded to a query by press time.)  The accusations on Tumblr and Facebook have yet to be verified because, for over a month, advocates say that Bakersfield police have not responded to queries. Advocates also note that the police’s apparent refusal to clarify the circumstances of the alleged homicide have exacerbated the transgender community’s frustration and fomented rampant speculation.

"Susana Villarreal (""Susy"")",53.0,2022-09-14,Durango,Mexico,24.0152128,-104.6700297,violence,stabbed,"Susy was killed in her bed. She was a well known member of her community who had acted in the Netflix series  This Wednesday, September 14, Durango's Susana Villarreal, who participated as an actress in the Netflix series Somos, was found dead, according to various LGBT+ groups and activists in the city of Durango.  The State Attorney General's Office (FGE) announced that the woman was 53 years old and lived in the Tierra Blanca neighborhood, located south of the city of Durango. Her body was found inside a dwelling and at first glance appeared to have wounds caused by a knife. The state agency indicates that it was approximately at 12:20 pm this Wednesday, when the body  was found. The authorities found out through a report to the C-5.  After the emergency call, the elements of the various security groups came and after entering inside a dwelling they found the body , which had a puncture wound in the neck. The Public Ministry (MP) ordered it be transfered to the facilities of the Forensic Medical Service (Semefo), where the doctors performed the autopsy. At the time of publication of this edition they had not determined the cause of death.  While in a statement published on her social networks, the Duranguense activist, Alejandra Roldán, confirmed the death of the actress and asked the media not to speculate about her death, for which she asked to wait for official information from the authorities. ""We also ask the corresponding authorities to open a line of investigation as a ""hate crime"" or ""transfeminicide"". Susy will always be a great woman and activist. The Great Susy rests in peace ,"" concludes Roldán's statement. ""Susy"", as they affectionately called her, was a trans woman who owned a dwelling in the city of Durango. Thanks to one of her friends she found out about the casting for the Netflix series Somos, which was specifically aimed at the LGBT+ community in the entity.  The six-part miniseries tells the story of the massacre that occurred in Allende, Coahuila, in 2011 at the hands of the Los Zetas cartel. Where several people from Durango gave a voice to the victims, people who put aside their daily lives and went to a casting to be part of ""Somos.""  Her friend encouraged Susana to go to the audition, but she never imagined that she would be selected. It was precisely her naturalness that earned her the role of ""Madame"", Allende's madrota , a character to whom it was not difficult to adapt since during a time of her life she worked in a bar where a quite similar environment was lived, to the pair that lived with [sex workers] and drunkards, he said in an exclusive interview for El Sol de Durango.  Her participation marked an important guideline in the LGBT+ community of Durango, since as a trans woman, Susana assured that there are more and more opportunities in various work fields , ""in my time you struggled to get any job due to social stigmas and currently the opportunity is for everyone regardless of sex, gender or sexual preference” , he recalled with a smile on his face.

Haley Gabriella Feldmann,19.0,2021-11-12,North Dakota,United States of America,46.9159866,-104.0251951,suicide,suicide,"Haley died by suicide. Although her family supported her throughout her transition, the more she learned of the hostility of some others the more she had retreated into herself. Haley Gabriella Feldmann was born on November 18, 2002. She was called boy and so we gave her a boy name—now a dead name. We gave her boy clothes, boy toys, boy things. We didn’t know she was our daughter and so we called her son and brother. Haley spent the first several years of her life content, within and without. She knew nothing of judgment or ridicule. She knew nothing but the love of her family, which she gave back in abundance.  During her adolescent years she retreated into herself and we lost her. She became silent . . . distant. She built formidable walls that became impossible to breach, and she stubbornly refused to grant us passage. She had begun to grow afraid of the world as she began to understand herself and who she was, and the reality of her situation became apparent. The more she learned of how the world would judge her for not being who it thought she should be, the more she withdrew. She was an atheist, unable to believe in any religion or deity that taught condemnation of her for not submitting to its beliefs of who she should be. She was a child of God, made perfectly in his image, her body only a vessel for the beautiful soul He created and with which He graced us. She laughed and she loved, and though her humor was dark, her nature was light. Her kindness, her empathy, her hope for others, and her desire to help anyone in need was a blinding light she shone on everyone but herself.  Haley gave us the gift of her truth, trusted us to see beyond her body to her soul, to believe her, and to love her. We will always be grateful for the chance to have her as she was and not who we had thought her to be. Now we call her daughter and sister and we closed ranks around her to protect her and to keep her safe from the willful ignorance that surrounds her. Our daughter Haley spent most days wreaking havoc on the universe, her time spent being “Imperial Empress of the Galaxies, Conqueror of Solar Systems, Creator of Planets and Nations, Destroyer of Stars”, and loving and adoring Lucy, her best friend and the Best Dog Ever, who loved and adored her in equal measure. She created her own language with a full alphabet and rules, spending years revising and perfecting it, and, in typical Haley fashion, did not leave a key. She created her own maps, detailed in geography, and her own countries, rich in their histories. She dropped out of school and then graduated before her peers, which made her immensely proud. She taught herself history, geography, politics, and never hesitated to school anyone on the finer points of each. And she was usually correct.  Haley lived most comfortably in a Discord community of just under six hundred people from all over the world, each of whom loved and adored her. We are just beginning to learn of her profound impact within the community and we are grateful they had her and she was loved by them. Her soul was radiant there, unhindered by its physical representation here which had become a prison, freeing her to breathe and be.  Haley ended her life on November 12, 2021, her pain being too great. She had grown weary of the knowledge of her reality, knowing this country and this world would never stop trying to force her to submit to its ignorance, and her family rages for her. We would’ve burned the whole world down if we’d thought it would keep her safe, and our fury and outrage is eclipsed only by our grief. We struggle against the currents that try to carry us away from love, for those currents only take us further from her. And she is far enough, already.Haley's ",2021.0,Beach,0,"['haley', 'died', 'by', 'suicide', 'although', 'her', 'family', 'supported', 'her', 'throughout', 'her', 'transition', 'the', 'more', 'she',

Lucha Zarate Vilcas,53.0,2016-02-20,Haute-Normandie,France,49.440459,1.093966,violence,shot,"Lucha was shot in the head. In July 2019 Mimoun Moumni, 38, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for her murder.An appeal in November 2020 confirmed the sentence.  A 38-year-old man was sentenced this Friday in France to 30 years in prison for the murder of a Peruvian transsexual prostitute in 2016 in the city of Rouen (northwest) and the assault of another, his lawyers told AFP.  The defendant, Mimoun Moumni, of Moroccan origin, was convicted of the murder of [deadname] Z., 53, who was found dead on the night of February 20, 2016 on the stairs of his property, with a wound in the skull.  The French investigators thought at first that her death was accidental, since the victim was wearing very high heels. But during the autopsy a very small caliber bullet was found, which the coroner had not seen.  The Eure (North-West) Court of Appeal followed the recommendations of the Public Prosecutor's Office by confirming the 30-year prison sentence handed down at first instance in July 2019 against Mimoun Moumni.  The man, who denies being responsible, ""is considering filing an appeal before the Court of Cassation,"" the highest French court, said his lawyers, asking that he be acquitted.  The accused, who did not speak during the hearing, was also convicted of having stabbed another Peruvian transsexual prostitute six times in 2015. The latter had crossed paths with her attacker again and noted the license plate number of her vehicle, which she communicated to the police during the investigation into the murder of her compatriot, said Cécile Madeline, a lawyer for the family of the deceased and the prostitute . attacked in 2015.",2016.0,Rouen,1,"['lucha', 'was', 'shot', 'in', 'the', 'head', 'in', 'july', '2019', 'mimoun', 'moumni', '38', 'was', 'sentenced', 'to', '30', 'years', 'in', 'prison', 'for', 'her', 'murder', 'an', 'appeal', 'in', 'november', '2020', 'confirmed', 'the', 'sentence', 'a', '38', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'sentenced', 'this', 'friday', 'in', 'france', 'to', '30', 'years', 'in', 'prison', 'for', 'the', 'murder', 'of', 'a', 'peruvian', 'transsexual', 'prostitute', 'in', '2016', 'in', 'the', 'city', 'of', 'rouen', 'northwest', 'and', 'the', 'assault', 'of', 'another', 'his', 'lawyers', 'told', 'afp', 'the', 'defendant', 'mimoun', 'moumni', 'of', 'moroccan', 'origin', 'was', 'convicted', 'of', 'the', 'murder', 'of', 'deadname', 'z', '53', 'who', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'on', 'the', 'night', 'of', 'february', '20', '2016', 'on', 'the', 'stairs', 'of', 'his', 'property', 'with', 'a', 'wound', 'in', 'the', 'skull', 'the', 'french', 'investigators', 'thought', 'at', 'first', 'that', 'her', 'death', 'was', 'accidental', 'since', 'the', 'victim', 'was', 'wearing', 'very', 'high', 'heels', 'but', 'during', 'the', 'autopsy', 'a', 'very', 'small', 'caliber', 'bullet', 'was', 'found', 'which', 'the', 'coroner', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'the', 'eure', 'north', 'west', 'court', 'of', 'appeal', 'followed', 'the', 'recommendations', 'of', 'the', 'public', ""prosecutor's"", 'office', 'by', 'confirming', 'the', '30', 'year', 'prison', 'sentence', 'handed', 'down', 'at', 'first', 'instance', 'in', 'july', '2019', 'against', 'mimoun', 'moumni', 'the', 'man', 'who', 'denies', 'being', 'responsible', 'is', 'considering', 'filing', 'an', 'appeal', 'before', 'the', 'court', 'of', 'cassation', 'the', 'highest', 'french', 'court', 'said', 'his', 'lawyers', 'asking', 'that', 'he', 'be', 'acquitted', 'the', 'accused', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'speak', 'during', 'the', 'hearing', 'was', 'also', 'convicted', 'of', 'having', 'stabbed', 'another', 'peruvian', 'transsexual', 'prostitute', 'six', 'times', 'in', '2015', 'the', 'latter', 'had', 'crossed', 'paths', 'with', 'her', 'attacker', 'again', 'and', 'noted', 'the', 'license', 'plate', 'number', 'of', 'her', 'vehicle', 'which', 'she', 'communicated', 'to', 'the', 'police', 'during', 'the', 'investigation', 'into', 'the', 'murder', 'of', 'her', 'compatriot', 'said', 'cécile', 'madeline', 'a', 'lawyer', 'for', 'the', 'family', 'of', 'the', 'deceased', 'and', 'the', 'prostitute', 'attacked', 'in', '2015']",lucha wa shot in the head in july 2019 mimoun moumni 38 wa sentenced to 30 year in prison for her murder an appeal in november 2020 confirmed the sentence a 38 year old man wa sentenced this friday in france to 30 year in prison for the murder of a peruvian transsexual prostitute in 2016 in the city of rouen northwest and the assault of another his lawyer told afp the defendant mimoun moumni of moroccan origin wa convicted of the murder of deadname z 53 who wa found dead on the night of february 20 2016 on the stair of his property with a wound in the skull the french investigator thought at first that her death wa accidental since the victim wa wearing very high heel but during the autopsy a very small caliber bullet wa found which the coroner had not seen the eure north west court of appeal followed the recommendation of the public prosecutor's office by confirming the 30 year prison sentence handed down at first instance in july 2019 against mimoun moumni the man who denies being responsible is considering filing an appeal before the court of cassation the highest french court said his lawyer asking that he be acquitted the accused who did not speak during the hearing wa also convicted of having stabbed another peruvian transsexual prostitute six time in 2015 the latter had crossed path with her attacker again and noted the license plate number of her vehicle which she communicated to the police during the investigation into the murder of her compatriot said cécile madeline a lawyer for the family of the deceased and the prostitute attacked in 2015

She had also been beaten and stabbed.Alessa was originally from Tabasco and was engaged in sex work to survive. She was also an activist and struggled to make visible the specific security needs of women engaged in sex work.Just a week earlier, she had participated in the Youth Capital Forum of the Youth Institute of Mexico City, where she spoke on “Sex work: Democratisation versus precarisation”. In her speech Alessa recalled that transgender sex workers lack protection and are exposed to dangers because their work is not recognized as a job. “Sex work is stigmatized by the idea of selling the body, an idea that the conservatives use to disqualify them because the workers make their bodies public and (for the conservatives) the women are not public, but this idea is wrong because all the workers sell his body, the same as a worker, as well as a clerk.”Alessa had been collaborating for two years in the placement of a day of the dead altar for sex workers, some of them murdered. The altar was to remember them, “remember they were here and they were very good,” Alessa said in a video recorded last year in November, just in front of the altar placed by Tlalpan’s sex workers.  “I hope I do not have to be on this poster, I hope I do not end up here and end up somewhere else, sex work is an option but I would not like to do that alone,” Alessa said in the video.",2016.0,Marin,1,"['alessa', 'flores', 'was', 'found', 'strangled', 'in', 'a', 'hotel', 'room', 'in', 'the', 'cuauhtémoc', 'branch', 'of', 'mexico', 'city', 'she', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'beaten', 'and', 'stabbed', 'alessa', 'was', 'originally', 'from', 'tabasco', 'and', 'was', 'engaged', 'in', 'sex', 'work', 'to', 'survive', 'she', 'was', 'also', 'an', 'activist', 'and', 'struggled', 'to', 'make', 'visible', 'the', 'specific', 'security', 'needs', 'of', 'women', 'engaged', 'in', 'sex', 'work', 'just', 'a', 'week', 'earlier', 'she', 'had', 'participated', 'in', 'the', 'youth', 'capital', 'forum', 'of', 'the', 'youth', 'institute', 'of', 'mexico', 'city', 'where', 'she', 'spoke', 'on', 'sex', 'work', 'democratisation', 'versus', 'precarisation', 'in', 'her', 'speech', 'alessa', 'recalled', 'that', 'transgender', 'sex', 'workers', 'lack', 'protection', 'and', 'are', 'exposed', 'to', 'dangers', 'because', 'their', 'work', 'is', 'not', 'recognized', 'as', 'a', 'job', 'sex', 'work', 'is', 'stigmatized', 'by', 'the', 'idea', 'of', 'selling', 'the', 'body', 'an', 'idea', 'that', 'the', 'conservatives', 'use', 'to', 'disqualify', 'them', 'because', 'the', 'workers', 'make', 'their', 'bodies', 'public', 'and', 'for', 'the', 'conservatives', 'the', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'public', 'but', 'this', 'idea', 'is', 'wrong', 'because', 'all', 'the', 'workers', 'sell', 'his', 'body', 'the', 'same', 'as', 'a', 'worker', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'a', 'clerk', 'alessa', 'had', 'been', 'collaborating', 'for', 'two', 'years', 'in', 'the', 'placement', 'of', 'a', 'day', 'of', 'the', 'dead', 'altar', 'for', 'sex', 'workers', 'some', 'of', 'them', 'murdered', 'the', 'altar', 'was', 'to', 'remember', 'them', 'remember', 'they', 'were', 'here', 'and', 'they', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'alessa', 'said', 'in', 'a', 'video', 'recorded', 'last', 'year', 'in', 'november', 'just', 'in', 'front', 'of', 'the', 'altar', 'placed', 'by', 'tlalpan', 's', 'sex', 'workers', 'i', 'hope', 'i', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'to', 'be', 'on', 'this', 'poster', 'i', 'hope', 'i', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'here', 'and', 'end', 'up', 'somewhere', 'else', 'sex', 'work', 'is', 'an', 'option', 'but', 'i', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'to', 'do', 'that', 'alone', 'alessa', 'said', 'in', 'the', 'video']",alessa flores wa found strangled in a hotel room in the cuauhtémoc branch of mexico city she had also been beaten and stabbed alessa wa originally from tabasco and wa engaged in sex work to survive she wa also an activist and struggled to make visible the specific security need of woman engaged in sex work just a week earlier she had participated in the youth capital forum of the youth institute of mexico city where she spoke on sex work democratisation versus precarisation in her speech alessa recalled that transgender sex worker lack protection and are exposed to danger because their work is not recognized a a job sex work is stigmatized by the idea of selling the body an idea that the conservative use to disqualify them because the worker make their body public and for the conservative the woman are not public but this idea is wrong because all the worker sell his body the same a a worker a well a a clerk alessa had been collaborating for two year in the placement of a day of the dead altar for sex worker some of them murdered the altar wa to remember them remember they were here and they were very good alessa said in a video recorded last year in november just in front of the altar placed by tlalpan s sex worker i hope i do not have to be on this poster i hope i do not end up here and end up somewhere else sex work is an option but i would not like to do that alone alessa said in the video

On March 9, Annick Dinelle’s life changed. Her child, who had asked to be called Alex, rather than [deadname], committed suicide. Alex’s questions about his gender identity and sexual orientation had begun in the months leading up to his death, his mother claims. “[He] had asked us if we would accept that she was gay, lesbian or trans. [He] was looking at [himself] a lot. As his parents, he had been told that no matter [how he identified] we were always going to love him”. The child had expressed her wish to wear a [binder] around [his] chest to hide [his] curves and even to have [his] breasts completely removed. For Christmas, he also wanted to receive boxers for boys as a present.  In the fall, Alex’s parents noticed a change of attitude in their child, who showed more and more aggressive behavior, which was not like him. The mother claims her child was allegedly bullied at school. To help Alex, his parents made an appointment with a doctor, in addition to consulting social workers. Just before spring break, an intervention plan was put in place to support Alex.

Alexa Negrón Luciano (Neulisa Luciano Ruiz),28.0,2020-02-24,Toa Baja,Puerto Rico,18.443047,-66.255144,violence,shot,"Alexa was shot dead several hours after a post denouncing her for using a women's restroom in a McDonalds restaurant had circulated on social media. Alexa Ruiz, a transgender woman driven to the streets was hunted down and killed 9 hours after social media posts appeared which accused her of peeping in bathroom stalls. The person who instigated her killing filed a false police report alleging that she had peeked in a fast-food bathroom stall and shared it on Facebook, He withdrew that complaint after police questioned him. By that time the lies that led to her death had gone viral and Alexa Ruiz was running for her life. Multiple videos recorded at different times and places show a terrified woman being hunted unmercifully. Those images do her a grave injustice and will not be shared here. The [LGBT+] activist and spokesman for the Puerto Rico for Everyone group, Pedro Julio Serrano, said the Police Bureau was the first to victimize Alexa by treating her as a man dressed as a woman. “She was a woman. She was called Alexa,” he said. **Who was Alexa?** According to information compiled by the CABE, Alexa was born in 1991 in the municipality of Carolinas, near San Juan, in a poor and dysfunctional family. ""Apparently, she was the type of trans person who is expelled from the family or who has suffered violence, including sexual, within the family,"" says Pagan. After her murder, several people who met her told on social networks that they had seen her walk through several municipalities of Puerto Rico. ""She was a homeless person who had mental health conditions and wandered around different areas. Here it is necessary to explain that being transgender is not a mental health condition, although there are transgender people, as it seems to be this case, that given the violence they have suffered may suffer mental conditions"".On 6th August 2021 three suspects were arrested by the FBI: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested this morning three men identified as  Jordany Laboy García, Christian Yamaurie Rivera Otero and Anthony Steven Lobos Ruiz, linked to the death of the transgender woman Alexa. The subjects were indicted by a federal grand jury and appeared today at the initial hearing before a magistrate where they face three charges: conspiracy to commit hate crime, violation of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act and obstruction of justice.

When a transgender woman was attacked in a Dallas parking lot in April, cellphone camera footage of the episode made national headlines, and the police investigated it as a possible hate crime.  A month later, on Sunday, the Dallas Police Department announced that the woman, Muhlaysia Booker, 23, had been shot and killed. The police said it had no evidence linking the killing to the earlier attack.  Police responded to the shooting call in the 7200 block of Valley Glen Drive at around 6:40 a.m near the Tenison Park Golf Course. She was found dead from a gunshot wound.  At a news conference, Maj. Vincent Weddington said that officers found Ms. Booker shortly before 7 a.m. on Saturday, and that her identity was confirmed on Sunday. They had been responding to a report of a shooting and found Ms. Booker “lying facedown in the street, deceased from homicidal violence,” he said.  Major Weddington added that Edward Thomas, the man who was arrested after he was filmed repeatedly punching Ms. Booker last month, was no longer in police custody, but that there was no indication he was linked to the killing. At a news conference after she was attacked last month, Ms. Booker stood on a podium and faced a group of supporters, several of whom carried signs in support of transgender people.  “This has been a rough week for myself, the transgender community and also the city of Dallas,” Ms. Booker said.  “This time, I can stand before you,” she added. “Whereas in other scenarios, we are at a memorial.”In June 2019 Kendrell Lavar Lyles, 34, was arrested and charged with three counts of murder. Lyles is also the person of interest in the death of Chynal Lindsey, 26, whose body was found in White Rock Lake on June 1.  Police said in May that the 22-year-old murder of Booker had similarities to two other attacks on transgender women, a murder in October and a stabbing in April, of which the victim survived.  In October, Brittany White, 29, was found dead from gunshot wounds in a vehicle parked southeast of Dallas. In April, a transgender woman was stabbed several times and left for dead in South Dallas. The woman survived and gave information on hers attacker.  Police said they were looking for links to another case in which remains of a transgender woman were found in Oak Cliff in 2017.

Bianca Pereira Guedes,25.0,2008-07-11,Goias,Brazil,-17.721544,-48.158118,medical,cosmetic filler complications,"Biana died after a cosmetic filler injection. The person who injected her was arrested 11 years later on charges of manslaughter. Transsexual Ana Beatriz Miranda, 48, was arrested last Tuesday (1) suspected of manslaughter, when there is no intention to kill. The crime occurred in 2008. She is accused, according to the Civil Police, of the death of [deadname] Pereira Guedes, 25 at the time of the facts was also transsexual, and known as Bianca. The suspicion is that Ana had injected industrial silicone into the victim in Ipameri, the city where they lived, and after the application the victim had complications and died. Prior to the case, Ana was known in the city as Kate Mahoney. The name is a reference to the police character of the American TV series ""Golden Lady"" of the 1980s. In a letter of September 3 this year, at the request of the Civil Police, the Morrinhos Registry issued a letter informing about the change of names of Ana, who first moved from Coriolano Marques dos Santos to Keithy Marques, in 2007 and 2012. to Ana Beatriz Miranda. In August last year, an arrest warrant was issued requesting the arrest of the accused, but only now she was found in Caldas Novas, southern Goiás. The holder of the municipality's Specialized Women's Service (Deam) police station, Rodrigo Pereira says the agents found Ana Beatriz after holding a bell, around 7 pm on Tuesday. ""She offered no resistance and was sent to the prison unit of Caldas Novas"", reports. The investigator also explained that the municipal police acted only in prison, but will not handle the case. ""As the investigation is from Ipameri, it will be heard by the responsible delegate of the city, but for the moment remains in the prison of Caldas Novas,"" he explained. According to him, there is not yet a definite date of when the transfer will be made. The report came in contact with the Ipameri Forum, and an attendant, who declined to be named, said the agency had not yet been informed of Ana Beatriz's arrest. According to the investigations, she is also suspected of applying industrial silicone to others, but the other cases have not yet been ascertained. Bianca died on July 11, 2008, a few days after the application of industrial silicone in Ipameri. In a report by TV Anhanguera at the time of the facts, her partner Reginaldo, who did not have his last name revealed, gave an interview and reported the situation. According to him, his girlfriend went to Ana's house on the 7th of that month and paid about R $ 400 to place two silicone prostheses in the chest region. Also according to Reginaldo, Bianca began to feel sick right at the time of application. ""She even fainted and they kept on applying,"" he said in the interview. TV Anhanguera learned that after that, Bianca was admitted to the Municipal Emergency Room on the 10th, and as there was no ward, she was referred to a private clinic. The doctor who attended Bianca at the time, Agnaldo Filho, told the TV report that she had a cough, fever and chest pain. Upon evaluation, it was found to be pneumonia in both lungs. At about 10 am on the 11th she had a cardiac arrest and died of respiratory failure. At the family's request, the body was taken to the city's IML, and only after the report confirmed that the death would be as a result of the application of the substance. The Ipameri Civil Police heard Ana Beatriz's statement on the night of September 14 of that year, but after the clarifications, was released. The investigation at the time was conducted by Deputy Victor Margon, who is currently responsible for the Goianira police station. The POPULAR sought contact with the delegate, but received no return. A friend of Bianca - killed after applying industrial silicone in 2008 - told an interview with TV Anhanguera at the time of the facts, which also underwent the procedure at the hands of the accused Ana Beatriz, arrested last Tuesday (1), in Caldas Novas, which at the time was called Kate Mahoney. She reported that she did the procedure twice and paid $ 600 for each application. Despite realizing the dream, she stated that she knew the risks and did not recommend the use. ""I'm happy with my breasts, but I wouldn't do it again,"" he added. Despite her friend's death, she did not want to see a doctor to make an assessment for fear of the outcome. Merchant Luciene Borges Cortez, Bianca's aunt, told TV she hoped her niece's death would serve as an example. “I want to warn other [trans women] not to do what Bianca did. She was in perfect health,” she lamented. Bianca was buried on July 13, 2008, in Vila Rica, Mato Grosso, where her parents lived. The victim worked the farm, according to her aunt and even aware of the danger refused to give up the dream. The merchant also stated that she had already warned her niece about the risks of using industrial silicone. It was the second time she had applied the product to her body.Bianca's death was not recorded in the official TDoR 2008 memorial list.",2008.0,Ipameri,0,"['biana', 'died', 'after', 'a', 'cosmetic',

Krys Brandon Ruiz,26.0,2021-03-28,California,United States of America,34.6390329,-120.4599919,violence,shot,"Krys was shot dead by police in circumstances which are unclear. An attorney has called for an investigation.The officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave. An attorney is calling for the California Attorney General to investigate the March 28 officer-involved shooting of a Lompoc transgender male because of officials' alleged conflicts of interest in a letter sent to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office, the District Attorney's office and the Lompoc Police Department.  Krys Brandon Ruiz, 26, died from a fatal gunshot wound following an altercation with Lompoc Police officers minutes after they received a report of a person walking northbound on H Street with a handgun shortly after 8 p.m., according to Capt. Kevin Martin.  The case was turned over to the office of Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown, who was the Lompoc police chief from 1995 to 2006 before becoming Sheriff.   Bill Schmidt, a Fresno-based attorney representing Ruiz's family, cited as a foundation for the request Government Code 12525.3, which deals with police shootings of unarmed people, and AB 1506, a law approved by the governor on Sept. 30, 2020, that requires a state prosecutor to investigate when police use deadly force.   ""Bill Brown oversaw the recruitment and training of that city's police officers,"" Schmidt wrote in the April 7 letter addressed to the sheriff's office and the attorney general's office. ""Sheriff Brown is not only the county's top law enforcement officer, he is also the coroner, charged with determining the manner and cause of death in this and similar cases.""   Additionally, Schmidt said the Attorney General should investigate because District Attorney Joyce Dudley helped develop statewide deadly force training and has never prosecuted an officer involved in a deadly shooting.   Dudley confirmed receipt of Schmidt's letter on Friday, but did not offer comment and referred to the sheriff's office, which responded to an emailed inquiry, but did not provide comment.   Neither the Lompoc Police Department nor the attorney general's office responded to requests for comment on Friday.   An hour before the shooting, Ruiz was dropped off at his apartment by his mother after dinner, blocks away from the shooting location, according to Schmidt, adding Ruiz wasn't intoxicated or agitated.   ""We don’t know what happened, whether they were trying to take him into custody for some reason, but we believe that it was virtually impossible that he had a gun, as far as we know,"" Schmidt said. ""The reality is that the police control all of the evidence and all of the information.""   Schmidt believes the shooting involved poor training standards, although he added that has yet to be seen. He filed a records request Thursday with Lompoc Police to release information about the incident, including all video recordings. A memorial service for Krys was held on Friday 16th April. According to his obituary: Krys faced many challenges in his short life. At the age of seven, he was diagnosed with Type-1 Diabetes and dealt with the daily struggles of the disease with courage and strength. Family and friends rallied around him and supported his health and wellness journey.  Krys was passionate about music and he followed many artists over the years in different genres, such as: Hip Hop, R & B, Oldies, Country, Mexican and Reggae. Krys loved to sing karaoke and would sing alone or in the company of others, many times using the popular apps Smule and Tiktok. More recently, he began to write music lyrics both serious and funny in nature. He also wrote poetry. Krys loved Demi Lovato; he knew all of her songs. He found a connection to her through her life struggles and lyrics. Krys also loved Vicente Fernandez, Los Tigres del Norte, Los Freddy's, Jenni Rivera, and Selena. Music was a special talent Krys had and he will be remembered through the many musical recordings he left behind.  Krys was blessed in life with good, solid friendships over the years. He usually bonded with those that shared his love for either music or dogs. Some of Krys' special friends are, Kira Kazianka, Bri Gusman, and Baylee Roche. They all bonded and remained close friends over the years, despite distance and time.  Krys's smile lit up any room; it was very captivating. He was known for his ever-changing hair color. Along with his love of painting his face in different ways (from clown faces to scary faces and a short emo phase) he loved wearing baseball caps, comfy t-shirts, sunglasses and creative masks.",2021.0,Lompoc,1,"['krys', 'was', 'shot', 'dead', 'by', 'police', 'in', 'circumstances', 'which', 'are', 'unclear', 'an', 'attorney', 'has', 'called', 'for', 'an', 'investigation', 'the',

Jasper Aaron Lynch,26.0,2022-07-07,Virginia,United States of America,38.9580273,-77.1855275,violence,shot,"Aaron was shot by police during a mental health crisis. HRC is deeply saddened to learn of the death of Aaron Lynch, a 26-year-old transgender man who was shot and killed by police in McClean, Virginia on July 7. Aaron’s death is at least the 26th violent killing of a transgender or gender non-conforming person in 2022. We say “at least” because too often these deaths go unreported — or misreported.  At 26, Aaron had his whole life in front of him. My thoughts and prayers are with Aaron’s loved ones. Aaron’s death is a tragic result of our system’s ineffectiveness in caring for people who are struggling mentally and emotionally. People, especially those of multiple marginalized identities, suffer every day as a result. His life did not have to end like this. We demand more focus and funding on mental health care in our country, including the addition of mental health counselors to respond to certain critical situations. No family should have to bear this pain.""  On July 7, police responded to a call made by a friend who was concerned about Aaron’s wellbeing and went to his home to check in on him. It was reported that police arrived with a trained mental health co-responder but Aaron was not found on the property. Police then returned a second time without the co-responder. After a back-and-forth with police, officers attempted to tase Aaron unsuccessfully. One officer then fired his weapon, shooting Aaron four times. No officers were injured and Aaron was pronounced dead at the scene. The shooting is under investigation and all involved officers have been placed on restricted duty.  Aaron’s family released the following statement to local press:  “Our son, Aaron, was experiencing a severe mental health crisis on July 7. He was scared and asked for both of the 911 calls that were made that day. We believe that the three police officers who answered the second 911 call could have, and should have, handled this far differently. To respond to Aaron’s mental health crisis by shooting him at all, let alone multiple times, cannot be justified. We recognize that, at times, police officers face grave and unknown dangers in the line of duty, but that was not the case for that call at our home regarding our son. Aaron was about 5’ 6"", slightly built, and holding just a bottle and a decorative mask. As parents, we mourn the heartbreaking loss of our son and are left with only memories and regret. Had we known there was any possibility that the police responding to the second 911 call would use lethal force against Aaron during a mental health crisis, we would not have involved them until a mental health counselor could be present, as was the case for the response to the first 911 call. We hope our efforts to find out more about this incident will, in the future, help families in similar situations avoid such a tragic outcome.”",2022.0,McLean,1,"['aaron', 'was', 'shot', 'by',

Dorce Gamalama,58.0,2022-02-16,Jakarta Raya,Indonesia,-6.2399349,106.7910124,medical,COVID-19,"Dorce passed away in hospital due to complications from COVID-19. Popular trans entertainer Dorce Gamalama has died in Indonesia from complications related to COVID-19, but her family has decided she should be buried as a man. Gamalama, a well-known pop singer and TV presenter who even had her own talkshow, the Dorce Show, passed away in hospital in Jakarta on Wednesday (16 February). She was often referred to as Bunda (mother) Dorce. The 58-year-old had been diagnosed with COVID-19 three weeks previously, and other health conditions including Alzheimer’s and diabetes increased the severe complications associated with the virus. Gamalama had been openly trans for decades, having undergone gender affirmation surgery in 1983 and even winning a legal battle to have her gender legally recognised. In an interview last month, she referenced her deteriorating health in an interview and announced: “[I would like to be buried] as I am now. Because after my surgery, I have a female genitalia, so women should bathe me, and bathe [and bury] me as a woman.” However, as a devout Muslim, she added the decision would ultimately lie with faith leaders. Following her public announcement that she would like to be buried as a woman, the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI), Indonesia’s top Islamic scholars body, said in a statement that the body of a trans person must always be buried according to their gender assigned at birth. So, despite her final wishes, her family and religious leaders decided that she should be bathed and buried as a man. Carahanna Marianne Sam, a trans campaign manager at an NGO in South Jakarta, told The Jakarta Post that despite her limited involvement with the LGBT+ community in Indonesia, Gamalama made a huge impact by being visible. “I hope we can have more Dorce Gamalamas in Indonesia,” she said. “She’s still a hero. Just by being out there and existing, she already has done more than half of what the rest of us have done.”",2022.0,Jakarta,0,"['dorce', 'passed', 'away', 'in', 'hospital', 'due', 'to', 'complications', 'from', 'covid', '19', 'popular', 'trans', 'entertainer', 'dorce', 'gamalama', 'has', 'died', 'in', 'indonesia', 'from', 'complications', 'related', 'to', 'covid', '19', 'but', 'her', 'family', 'has', 'decided', 'she', 'should', 'be', 'buried', 'as', 'a', 'man', 'gamalama', 'a', 'well', 'known', 'pop', 'singer', 'and', 'tv', 'presenter', 'who', 'even', 'had', 'her', 'own', 'talkshow', 'the', 'dorce', 'show', 'passed', 'away', 'in', 'hospital', 'in', 'jakarta', 'on', 'wednesday', '16', 'february', 'she', 'was', 'often', 'referred', 'to', 'as', 'bunda', 'mother', 'dorce', 'the', '58', 'year', 'old', 'had', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'with', 'covid', '19', 'three', 'weeks', 'previously', 'and', 'other', 'health', 'conditions', 'including', 'alzheimer', 's', 'and', 'diabetes', 'increased', 'the', 'severe', 'complications', 'associated', 'with', 'the', 'virus', 'gamalama', 'had', 'been', 'openly', 'trans', 'for', 'decades', 'having', 'undergone', 'gender', 'affirmation', 'surgery', 'in', '1983', 'and', 'even', 'winning', 'a', 'legal', 'battle', 'to', 'have', 'her', 'gender', 'legally', 'recognised', 'in', 'an', 'interview', 'last', 'month', 'she', 'referenced', 'her', 'deteriorating', 'health', 'in', 'an', 'interview', 'and', 'announced', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'be', 'buried', 'as', 'i', 'am', 'now', 'because', 'after', 'my', 'surgery', 'i', 'have', 'a', 'female', 'genitalia', 'so', 'women', 'should', 'bathe', 'me', 'and', 'bathe', 'and', 'bury', 'me', 'as', 'a', 'woman', 'however', 'as', 'a', 'devout', 'muslim', 'she', 'added', 'the', 'decision', 'would', 'ultimately', 'lie', 'with', 'faith', 'leaders', 'following', 'her', 'public', 'announcement', 'that', 'she', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'be', 'buried', 'as', 'a', 'woman', 'the', 'indonesia', 'ulema', 'council', 'mui', 'indonesia', 's', 'top', 'islamic', 'scholars', 'body', 'said', 'in', 'a', 'statement', 'that', 'the', 'body', 'of', 'a', 'trans', 'person', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'buried', 'according', 'to', 'their', 'gender', 'assigned', 'at', 'birth', 'so', 'despite', 'her', 'final', 'wishes', 'her', 'family', 'and', 'religious', 'leaders', 'decided', 'that', 'she', 'should', 'be', 'bathed', 'and', 'buried', 'as', 'a', 'man', 'carahanna', 'marianne', 'sam', 'a', 'trans', 'campaign', 'manager', 'at', 'an', 'ngo', 'in', 'south', 'jakarta', 'told', 'the', 'jakarta', 'post', 'that', 'despite', 'her', 'limited', 'involvement', 'with', 'the', 'lgbt', 'community', 'in', 'indonesia', 'gamalama', 'made', 'a', 'huge', 'impact', 'by', 'being', 'visible', 'i', 'hope', 'we', 'can', 'have', 'more', 'dorce', 'gamalamas', 'in', 'indonesia', 'she', 'said', 'she', 's', 'still', 'a', 'hero', 'just', 'by', 'being', 'out', 'there', 'and', 'existing', 'she', 'already', 'has', 'done', 'more', 'than', 'half', 'of', 'what', 'the', 'rest', 'of', 'us', 'have', 'done']",dorce passed away in hospital due to complication from covid 19 popular trans entertainer dorce gamalama ha died in indonesia from complication related to covid 19 but her family ha decided she should be buried a a man gamalama a well known pop singer and tv presenter who even had her own talkshow the dorce show passed away in hospital in jakarta on wednesday 16 february she wa often referred to a bunda mother dorce the 58 year old had been diagnosed with covid 19 three week previously and other health condition including alzheimer s and diabetes increased the severe complication associated with the virus gamalama had been openly trans for decade having undergone gender affirmation surgery in 1983 and even winning a legal battle to have her gender legally recognised in an interview last month she referenced her deteriorating health in an interview and announced i would like to be buried a i am now because after my surgery i have a female genitalia so woman should bathe me and bathe and bury me a a woman however a a devout muslim she added the decision would ultimately lie with faith leader following her public announcement that she would like to be buried a a woman the indonesia ulema council mui indonesia s top islamic scholar body said in a statement that the body of a trans person must always be buried according to their gender assigned at birth so despite her final wish her family and religious leader decided that she should be bathed and buried a a man carahanna marianne sam a trans campaign manager at an ngo in south jakarta told the jakarta post that despite her limited involvement with the lgbt community in indonesia gamalama made a huge impact by being visible i hope we can have more dorce gamalamas in indonesia she said she s still a hero just by being out there and existing she already ha done more than half of what the rest of u have done

Nicole Galisteu,20.0,2013-01-05,Parana,Brazil,-25.366923,-49.2470586,violence,shot,"Nicole was on a night out at a club when three men propositioned her. When they discovered that she was not a cisgender woman, they killed her. The 20-year-old [trans woman] [deadname] Generoso, also known as “Nicole Galisteu”, was murdered last Sunday (5) in the Santa Cândida neighborhood after the men who were meeting her discovered that Galisteu was not a [cisgender] woman. The information was passed by the Homicide Police of Curitiba (DH) on Tuesday (8). According to the expert, three suspects of involvement in the crime were arrested and despite claiming to be innocent the evidence confirms their participation. “They went out in a club and two of their friends started making fun of one of them by saying they were kissing a man. When they saw that he really was a transvestite, they took the gun from the house and killed Bruno Galisteu because of this, ”said Chief Officer Rubens Recalcatti of DH. One of them became interested in Nicole; The two of them exchanged kisses, but a macho man noticed she was [transgender]. At this point, the (usual) game that allows the perpetuation of male domination began. Rather than drawing the straight-male friend's attention to the fact that he was interested in a [trans woman], the pack took a step in restoring his ""softness."" There is nothing wrong with a straight man being attracted to a trans woman, wanting and kissing her. Male chauvinistic codes of conduct, however, require men who claim the label of heterosexuality to be ready to do anything, to commit any brutality or insanity to prove their masculinity. Anything at all, even premeditating murder, as Nicole's murderers did. Two of them went home for a weapon while the third distracted the [trans woman] and ensured that she would not leave the club. When they returned, they continued to act as if nothing had happened and offered to take her home, on the way they got her out of the car, shot 7 times at her, then drove the car over her body. The press boasted that Nicole was murdered because she was ""mistaken for a woman."" Almost a defense of the ""prerogative"" of male domination to ""wash honor with blood"" when ""deceived"".

Quinn Mowrer Gustin,20.0,2022-03-24,Utah,United States of America,40.7765233,-112.0605692,suicide,suicide,"Quinn died by suicide. Quinn Mowrer Gustin’s mom says Quinn loved animals more than anything. She had an affinity for stray cats, and would regularly feed them. She was always there for her friends, and always knew how to make the people around her laugh. She was unapologetically trans and queer. She was always willing to defend anyone from the hatred of the world. Quinn lost her battle with mental health on March 24.*[Editor's Note: We don't know where Quinn passed away, but as she was from Salt Lake CIty that is the location given on this page.]*Her family were supportive, but as every trans person knows, there is nearly always *someone* who you once trusted who lets you down. The following (extracted from an article by her mum written 5 months before her death) tells a heartening but heartbreakingly familiar story: November of 2017, my kiddo told me she was transgender and was a girl. This actually didn’t shock me at all – or even register too big. I kind of assumed it was a phase because of the boyfriend, but she had been prepping me over time so it wasn’t hard to hear. Honestly, I heard it but didn’t even register. I didn’t realize until about two years later that it had been her coming out moment! She didn’t feel the need to “keep it a secret” and said we could tell anyone we wanted – which, at the time, was no one!  The next month, we traveled to spend Christmas with family. I decided that my family members were the realest friends I had and I should “prep” them so that our now daughter could come out to them. The reaction from my in-laws was textbook awesome and they were SO compassionate and supportive. I went for a ride with two of my siblings and told them and they also were amazing. They expressed concern for my wellbeing but loved my kiddo unconditionally. They didn’t know anything about transgender people, but loved my daughter enough that it didn’t even matter.  Seems like a dream come true – but not quite. The hardest part came later that afternoon with our family gathering of about 20 (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc). One family member, who didn’t know about my kiddo yet, because time hadn’t allowed, started talking about the “weird” cashier at the local grocery store and how they were so uncomfortable because they don’t know if “it” was a He or She. The conversation went on and on in the most horribly transphobic fashion regardless of how many times I tried to subtly steer it in a more positive way. I hadn’t yet learned to breath fire and was more worried that my kiddo had left the room when the conversation started, than I was about teaching those making the terrible remarks how damaging they were. To this day, my child prefers to not be with this family member because she feels she saw their true colors before they knew she was transgender. It didn’t matter that I had tried to stand up for trans people – my daughter was crying and angry (at me, because she could) for not being a strong enough ally for the checker who was being persecuted behind their back. My fire had been lit and I vowed never to allow that in my presence from anyone.  That fall, she was using the new name with everyone and asked all of her teachers to call her Quinn. She presented exclusively female. She broke up with the toxic boyfriend. One day, I was approached by the yearbook teacher and asked how they should list her in the yearbook. I said I thought she would prefer to be called Quinn – but I would confirm. I casually mentioned it to Quinn and asked what she wanted. She sat up from lounging gloomily on the couch and with a look of awe and wonderment asked if I really would allow her to be listed as Quinn.  You know those moments where it feels like the clouds clear, the heavens shine down radiant heavenly beams, and the angels are singing because there is PURE JOY on your child’s face? This was that moment for us! After all of the pain and turmoil and hurt, this was our moment. It was the look on your child’s face the first time they see fireworks explode in the night sky, or on Christmas morning when piles of presents have appeared, or the magical look of true love. I would never be Public Enemy #1 again, and she would be Quinn forever.  Yes, she could be listed as Quinn and once again – it was us against the world.  We fought the fight against dysphoria together. I cried with her when she didn’t recognize her own reflection as herself. I never complained when she would shower in the dark or run the steamy shower for way too long so she couldn’t see her reflection in the mirror. I waxed her eyebrows, upper lip, and armpits. I helped her get eyelash extensions and learn to straighten her hair. I still try hard to understand why sleeping in jeans is emotionally the safest, even though I don’t “get it”. After many ups and downs, in April of 2019, after she decided to graduate a year early, we decided to look into hormone options. We found a terrific doctor who really worked to educate us and help us make the best decisions. The day she got her first prescription for testosterone blockers and estrogen shots – we celebrated! It was the best day of her life up to that point!!!Rest in power, Quinn.Quinn's Facebook and LinkedIn profiles are  and ",2022.0,Magna,0,"['quinn', 'died', 'by', 'suicide', 'quinn', 'mowrer',

affinity for stray cat and would regularly feed them she wa always there for her friend and always knew how to make the people around her laugh she wa unapologetically trans and queer she wa always willing to defend anyone from the hatred of the world quinn lost her battle with mental health on march 24 editor's note we don't know where quinn passed away but a she wa from salt lake city that is the location given on this page her family were supportive but a every trans person know there is nearly always someone who you once trusted who let you down the following extracted from an article by her mum written 5 month before her death tell a heartening but heartbreakingly familiar story november of 2017 my kiddo told me she wa transgender and wa a girl this actually didn t shock me at all or even register too big i kind of assumed it wa a phase because of the boyfriend but she had been prepping me over time so it wasn t hard to hear honestly i heard it but didn t even register i didn t realize until about two year later that it had been her coming out moment she didn t feel the need to keep it a secret and said we could tell anyone we wanted which at the time wa no one the next month we traveled to spend christmas with family i decided that my family member were the realest friend i had and i should prep them so that our now daughter could come out to them the reaction from my in law wa textbook awesome and they were so compassionate and supportive i went for a ride with two of my sibling and told them and they also were amazing they expressed concern for my wellbeing but loved my kiddo unconditionally they didn t know anything about transgender people but loved my daughter enough that it didn t even matter seems like a dream come true but not quite the hardest part came later that afternoon with our family gathering of about 20 grandparent aunt uncle cousin etc one family member who didn t know about my kiddo yet because time hadn t allowed started talking about the weird cashier at the local grocery store and how they were so uncomfortable because they don t know if it wa a he or she the conversation went on and on in the most horribly transphobic fashion regardless of how many time i tried to subtly steer it in a more positive way i hadn t yet learned to breath fire and wa more worried that my kiddo had left the room when the conversation started than i wa about teaching those making the terrible remark how damaging they were to this day my child prefers to not be with this family member because she feel she saw their true color before they knew she wa transgender it didn t matter that i had tried to stand up for trans people my daughter wa cry and angry at me because she could for not being a strong enough ally for the checker who wa being persecuted behind their back my fire had been lit and i vowed never to allow that in my presence from anyone that fall she wa using the new name with everyone and asked all of her teacher to call her quinn she presented exclusively female she broke up with the toxic boyfriend one day i wa approached by the yearbook teacher and asked how they should list her in the yearbook i said i thought she would prefer to be called quinn but i would confirm i casually mentioned it to quinn and asked what she wanted she sat up from lounging gloomily on the couch and with a look of awe and wonderment asked if i really would allow her to be listed a quinn you know those moment where it feel like the cloud clear the heaven shine down radiant heavenly beam and the angel are singing because there is pure joy on your child s face this wa that moment for u after all of the pain and turmoil and hurt this wa our moment it wa the look on your child s face the first time they see firework explode in the night sky or on christmas morning when pile of present have appeared or the magical look of true love i would never be public enemy 1 again and she would be quinn forever yes she could be listed a quinn and once again it wa u against the world we fought the fight against dysphoria together i cried with her when she didn t recognize her own reflection a herself i never complained when she would shower in the dark or run the steamy shower for way too long so she couldn t see her reflection in the mirror i waxed her eyebrow upper lip and armpit i helped her get eyelash extension and learn to straighten her hair i still try hard to understand why sleeping in jean is emotionally the safest even though i don t get it after many ups and down in april of 2019 after she decided to

Claudia Vera,30.0,2019-03-30,Lima,Peru,-11.9891213,-77.0662328,violence,shot,"Claudia was shot in the Independencia district of Lima in the early hours of Saturday 30th March. On the street in the early hours were Claudia Vera and four other sex workers - also trans women of initial S, V, R and J, as confirmed by  witnesses in the area.  Suddenly a couple entered the scene. A man of Peruvian origin urinated on the lamp post, located a few meters from the hotel Las Vegas, where Claudia and her four companions were. Beside him was a woman with a Venezuelan accent.  The dawn remained silent until the thin man began to scream. ""Why the fuck are you looking at me, shit goats!"" He exclaimed, according to several witnesses on the block. The woman who accompanied him joined in immediately: ""Maricones! You are never going to be women. Pichulones, I do have a vagina! ""  The woman, with a motorcycle helmet in her right hand, tried to hit Claudia and her colleagues on the street. After a few minutes of struggle and a brief exchange of blows and shoves, the couple left on a motorcycle, threatening loudly that they would return to kill them.  Almost an hour after the street brawl at just after 6 in the morning, the threats of the aggressor couple were fulfilled. Four people on two bikes stopped abruptly in front of the Hotel Las Vegas and one of them, without taking off his helmet, shot four bullets at Claudia - hitting here in the arm (near the shoulder), head, back and hip. A fifth bullet hit a passer-by on the leg identified as Jesús Montesinos Álvarez (30).  Two of the other sex workers who were with Claudia managed to enter the Hotel Las Vegas and, after a struggle with the shooter, shut the door. The slogan of the executioner was clear: to kill all the trans women he met on his way.  ""They killed a fag!"" Shouted the receptionist on duty at the nearby hotels. Another receptionist told Wayka that she even heard more than 5 shots and that she did not want to see Claudia's body on the floor, face down, half stooped, with a pool of blood under her face and another half a meter away, suggesting that she had crawled before she died.Claudia was a trans activist, human rights defender and founder of Jóvenes Cambiando VIHdas, the HIV Youth Network in Peru. Today, in the day of trans visibility, various activists will meet in the place where they murdered Claudia to ask for justice for her and for all trans women murdered by transphobic violence and state neglect.  Sandy Sussel, trans activist and Claudia's partner, told Presentes that the sit-in that will be held at 5 PM seeks to do justice for Claudia, ""Because when it comes to a trans woman, the police do not investigate, they do not care who kills us and why?""  Various organizations and activists lament Claudia's death and demand the enactment of laws such as the law against hate crimes that protect the lives of trans people, who find themselves in a situation of total exclusion by the Peruvian State.  From the Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) of Peru they said: ""We regret the violent departure of Claudia Vera, trans fellow activist of Jóvenes Cambiando VIHdas, who contributed a lot to her outstanding work in favor of the community. Our condolences to friends and family. ""  The organization Sí a vida said: ""Not one more death! The human rights of transgender, gay, lesbian, bisexual and intersex people (TLGBI) are not backed by norms and laws in the country. Today one of our instructors and volunteers was killed by several shots at point-blank range in the public thoroughfare in the district of Independencia. The young activist and promoter of HIV prevention Claudia Vera, fought for trans women to live in a society free of violence and hate crimes are punished severely in the penal code.  Argentine activist for the rights of people with HIV Mariana Iacono wrote: ""I am deeply saddened. They murdered our beloved Claudia Vera. The first young trans woman to organize a meeting of young people with HIV in the history of Jóvenes Positivos LAC in Peru. Founder of the network of young people with HIV in Peru. With all her difficulties and help from other people she did not stop until she did it.  Trans hate - hatred for sex workers continue to kill them throughout Latin America. We ask for justice for Claudia, our friend and companion. Today Latin America and the Caribbean are in mourning because someone who thought the world could be a little better died.

I met Kai a couple of days after I moved into the Barton Community College dorms. We clicked instantly. Kai was funny, kind, and all-around a great person. We ate lunch together almost every day and even took composition one together. Honestly, he was a good person, and I will say that until my dying breath. Unfortunately, others did not think he was because of the way Kai identified himself. Kai was transgender. If you don't know this about me, I fully support the LGBTQ+ community and will say it with my entire chest. I believe that love is love and to be your true self. I admit that as soon as I transferred to hutch Kai, I lost touch, but that didn't make him any less of a friend to me.  Unfortunately, Kai committed suicide in his dorm at Barton Community College on March 27, 2022.Kai was studying to be an MLT but also wanted to be a nurse.

Paloma Vazquez,29.0,2022-02-26,Texas,United States of America,29.7039048,-95.4996303,violence,shot,"Paloma was found dead with gunshot wounds in her apartment on the evening of Saturday 26th February. A transgender woman was fatally shot Saturday inside her apartment in southwest Houston, police said.    The woman, who has not been publicly identified, was found with multiple gunshot wounds in the apartment in the 6600 block of Dunlap. Her boyfriend initially called police at 8 p.m. after coming upon her body, according to police.   Police said the woman appeared to live alone, and the door was unlocked when officers arrived. They found multiple shell casings in the apartment.   According to a recent report from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, last year was the deadliest on record for transgender and gender non-conforming people with at least 47 killed.   Anyone with information about the Houston case can call the Houston Police Department's homicide division at 713-308-3600 or Crime Stoppers 713-222-TIPS (8477).Paloma's identity only emerged subsequently. She had emigrated to the USA from Latin America 6 months earlier. The transgender woman shot to death in Houston has been identified as 29-year-old immigrant Paloma Vazquez. Vazquez, who was not identified in initial reports, was found dead in her apartment just days before Texas Gov. Greg Abbott directed the state to interpret trans-affirming care as child abuse. According to the Organization for Latina Trans in Texas, Vazquez immigrated to the United States six months ago. “As most trans women who are here from Latina America, they are here because they are scared of being killed in their own country,” a friend of the victim, Gia Pacheco, told KTRK Houston. “She had just moved into her new apartment and was very excited about decorating.” Another friend, Valentin Terrazas noted that Latin America can be particularly dangerous for transgender women. Transgender women, particularly Black and Latinx women, also face high rates of violence across the United States. “There’s a lot of transphobia in Latin America,” friend Valentin Terrazas added. “They come here for refuge and to better their lives and have a future here.”Paloma had only arrived in the USA 6 months earlier, having fled Honduras because of the violence there. Vazquez, who had arrived in the U.S. six months ago, was involved with the Organization for Latina Trans in Texas. A spokesperson for the group told the Daily News that the 29-year-old was from Honduras and that she had fled her native country because she was afraid of being targeted because she was trans. On Thursday, a large group of friends, human rights activists, as well as members of the transgender community gathered outside Houston City Hall to honor her life and bring attention to the alarming increase in the number of killings of transgender women of color in the U.S.",2022.0,Bellaire,1,"['paloma', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'with', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'in', 'her', 'apartment', 'on', 'the',

Techi,45.0,2019-05-29,Arequipa,Peru,-16.404093,-71.543837,suicide,possible suicide,"Techi's body was found in the waters of the rio del Chili on 29th May. She had last been seen three days earlier.Her death is being treated as a possible suicide. Techi's body had been dragged by the waters of the Chili River. The rocks contained it. She was almost naked, apparently the waters ripped off her clothes. An orange polo shirt wrapped around his face. It was impossible to say how long the corpse was submerged in the torrent. A neighbor notified the police of the find. While the body of the victim was removed, radios and virtual channels gave account of their physical features: a man of 45 to 50 years. The tragedy of Techi hit members of the trans community of Arequipa . She left home on May 26, and three days later, she was a corpse. The investigation considers a possible suicide, but the fact that her body had a polo shirt covering her face awakens the suspicion of this community, so tormented by violence and impunity.  Do you think it is a hate crime ? Ana Flavia Chávez, a transsexual woman, points out that determining that in Arequipa is difficult, as the law does not ensure a transparent investigation. For the law, only the body of a man was found in the river, there is no way to account for the fact that it was a person belonging to a vulnerable group.  In life Techi was encouraged to admit her gender identity at an already mature age. Ana Flavia says she started wearing tight clothes and letting her hair grow. This process was interrupted because her clients stopped buying from her. Then she went back to dressing as before while selling merchandise on the Andrés Avelino Cáceres shopping platform.

Jaheim Bella Pugh,19.0,2020-12-13,Alabama,United States of America,30.738558,-88.0999607,violence,shot,"Jaheim was killed while leaving a Christmas party. Bella Pugh, a Black gender non-confirming [Editor's Note: this is incorrect] teen, was shot to death after a Christmas party erupted into a night of violence earlier this month. The 19-year-old was slain at a residence in Rosedale Avenue in Prichard, Alabama on 13 December.  Reports suggest that after Pugh was shot, party-goers waited 20 minutes before calling emergency services. Some did nothing, others took out their mobile phones and recorded.  Pugh’s mother Tiffany told Fox10 News that it was their rainbow-coloured jumpsuit that led to their murder, saying: “If [they] wasn’t wearing that dress [they] would still be alive.”  At least two other people attending the party were also injured, according to the Prichard City Police Department. Officers added that a suspect, James Lee James Jr, turned himself in for questioning 16 December, NBC15 News reported.  He was later charged with murder and two counts of second-degree assault – however, authorities said that they are not investigating Pugh’s death as a hate crime. Their family disagree with the decision.  Tiffany believes Pugh “was killed because of what [they] was wearing, not because of who [they] was or what [they] did. I loved [them] with everything in me, that’s why [they] could shine like [they] did. Everything I had I poured into [Bella].”  Pugh’s father Antonio Ruggs reflected: “Love your kids for who they are. Because you know one day they could be here, the next day they can be gone,” he added, according to MyNBC15. Jaheim did not identify as trans, but was a newly out cisgender gay man who was exploring his identity. Kudos to HRC for honoring Jaheim Bella Pugh, a murdered cisgender gay man on their TDoR page.  The trouble is that HRC identifies Jaheim Bella Pugh as a Gender Non-Conforming‘ person. While technically correct this term is easily conflated and misunderstood as it describes gender, not sex.  Jaheim Bella Pugh, according to his mother, was a 19-year-old cisgender gay man just beginning to learn who he was. Bella was the name of his new puppy which he adopted as his drag name.  After thorough research, I could not find anywhere that he self-identified as a gender non-conforming or transgender person. There was one person who posted a tribute identifying Bella as transgender but that has since been refuted by multiple sources.  The whole idea behind the TDoR project which honors our dead is to investigate with integrity each individual and how they died. This is critical so that we may know who they were. Prior to the first TDoR, a trans-peer-led initiative, those who murdered us were arrested but never served jail time for their crimes.  However, there is no honor in superimposing a narrative that fits your needs while intentionally disregarding facts about a person’s life and death.",2020.0,Prichard,1,"['jaheim', 'was', 'killed',

They reported that she was not treated in time by the emergency services, pointing out that the Paramedics in an ambulance refused to transfer her to a healthcare facility. The Trans Community Network documented, through social networks, writing what happened to this woman, who worked as a sex worker in the city center, and explained that the doctors did not help her because she was a carrier of HIV-positiv. ""At 3 in the morning, Alejandra, a trans sex worker from the Santa Fe neighborhood, died after an ambulance refused to provide her medical service, after she told them that she was living with HIV. At this moment, her body is still in the room. She died drowned and without medical attention,"" they wrote on Twitter.One report even claims that the paramedics stood on a street corner smoking and drinking while she was suffering. After the long wait, Alejandra finally received medical attention. However, this was not encouraging, as she facing not only the respiratory condition but now also discrimination from the paramedics, who, leaving aside their code of ethics, made value judgments about the patient when they knew her HIV positive condition . The attitude they assumed was immediately negative, the witness tells us, and the more time passed, the worse Alejandra's situation got. There was talk of a possible ""Overdose"", a diagnosis given without evidence, that ""what she presented was going to go down"", that she should calm down and not take anything to eat because she could choke, but at that time she was already drowning. ""NO, you see her wrong, I'm very scared, please take her to the hospital, my God!"" Diana [Alejandra's friend] begged the first aid personnel, but the only response they received was that she could not be transferred to a Medical Center because she had no symptoms of Covid. The indications they gave her were to be aware that ""this is going to go down"" (referring to the alleged overdose) A diagnosis that cost her her life. Despite seeing her without air and having taken oxygen in the ambulance, they did nothing more to help her and preferred to go to a corner to drink red wine and smoke a cigarette, showing a callous and inhuman attitude.

Ty Underwood,24.0,2015-01-26,Washington,United States of America,47.4361,-117.782501,violence,shot,"Ty was shot to death in her car. Her last communication had been with a potential date via a chat app but she had been beginning to have doubts about him.Carlton Ray Champion Jr., 21, was convicted of first degree murder. A confession never comes, but there's enough evidence to put Carlton Champion in front of a jury.  ""He kind of laughed and chuckled the whole time,"" said Ty Underwood's friend Kenyaah Darks. ""You see his lawyer kind of like tapping him telling him to be quiet, straighten up, sit up and things like that, and he took it as a joke.""  But it's no joke when the verdict comes in: Guilty of first-degree murder. He could have received as little as five years, but after another outburst of arrogance in court, Champion gets life.  But even that life sentence doesn't stop him from taunting still members of Ty's family as he leaves the courtroom.  ""Carlton Champion Jr. killed Ty Underwood because he was afraid the secret was gonna come out, that if this relationship went south, everyone was gonna find out that he's in a relationship with a transgender woman, and he could not take that thought,"" said Cory McCoy.  Unbelievably, Carlton Champion still thinks he can get out of this. He sent a letter to Crime Watch Daily, writing ""the police did dirty work"" and that he's ""looking good, feeling good... Waiting to get free so I can see what the world got to offer me.""  Champion's lawyer indicated his client will appeal.

Jóse Salazar,34.0,2016-02-21,Buenos Aires,Argentina,-34.69661,-58.3889,violence,beaten,"Jóse's body was found found half-naked in the street after she had gone out on a date. She had been beaten and possibly raped. The wildly beaten corpse of a 34-year-old Peruvian trans woman appeared abandoned on the street. According to the police, the victim was beaten and raped by a group of people.   According to the newspaper Crónica published in its print edition on Tuesday, the macabre finding occurred when members of the 2nd station of Florencio Varela received a complaint, which referred to a dead person on public roads at the junction of 513 and 542, in the mentioned district, in the south of the provincial conurbano . Immediately, the members of the section arrived at the place, an opportunity in which they observed the body without life and upside down that had women's clothes. The deceased was dressed in a top, pollera, high-heeled shoes and underwear that had been lowered at the level of the thighs. The victim also had blows to her face.

Victoria Carmen White,28.0,2010-09-12,New Jersey,United States of America,40.730838,-74.278,violence,shot,"Victoria was killed at 5 am in a relative's apartment. Alrashim Chambers, 24, and Marquise Foster, 26, were charged with murder after surrendering to police in October. I can't even begin to explain the pain that my heart feels. Such a wonderful, caring, loving, woman was taken out of this world—for what reason?  She touched so many lives and so many looked up to her and were inspired by her. She taught us how to live our life to the fullest and how to push drama out of it. She was the sweetest person and would give you the shirt off her back if you needed it. She was always generous with her money, even though sometimes she just shouldn't have been. But that was my April [a name that some of Victoria's older friends new her by].  She was always caring and worrying about others and making sure her loved ones had what they needed.  But she also knew when to stand her ground and when to get rid of the fake people in her life.Foster took a plea deal, but Chambers was acquitted. In the end, it came down to the accused killer’s word against that of his former co-defendant.  Alrashim Chambers was charged with fatally shooting a transgender woman in Maplewood after discovering her sexual identity. His one-time accomplice, who has since taken a plea deal, pointed the finger at Chambers. But Chambers pointed it right back.  An Essex County jury made its decision today when it acquitted Chambers on all counts in the Sept. 12, 2010, slaying of 28-year-old Victoria Carmen White.  The jury found Chambers, of Newark, not guilty of murder, bias intimidation and two weapons offenses. Chambers, 25, who maintained his innocence from the beginning and took the stand in his own defense, had faced up to life in prison if convicted of murder.Victoria was from Newark. Investigators believed that she was killed after her killer learnt that she was transgender. Minutes later, the party turned deadly.  Sharon White and Wray said they heard a man yell: ""You a dude?"" followed by three gunshots.  The bathroom door was closed at that point so neither could tell who fired the shots. They also couldn’t tell who uttered the statement, the tone of which sounded like ""a question, with anger,"" as Sharon White put it.""",2010.0,Maplewood,1,"['victoria', 'was', 'killed', 'at', '5',

Storing the tractor behind a wall, he noticed that there was a dead person on the scene and immediately called the police.  Initially, the victim was believed to be a [cisgender] woman, since - despite the advanced state of decomposition - she wore a white blouse, carried a female bag and had her panties lowered to the middle of her leg.  However, upon examination of the crime scene experts, it turned out that the victim of violent death was actually [trans woman] who was killed with a blow to the head.

We are deeply saddened to learn about the passing of MBLGTACC 2019 Conference Chair Rexy Que. Rexy was passionate about using data analysis to shift public policy. They were a performer, musician, advocate and strong force in the state of Kansas pushing for necessary change. Friends and colleagues of Rexy speak of their impact on their lives in educational, organizing and social spaces. They were an eager leader and familiar face at TransKansas, the South Central Chapter of Equality Kansas and Wichita State University. It is always a disheartening day to lose trans and nonbinary kin.

The Gender Interactive Alliance (GIA) and Aurat March officials held a joint press conference on Thursday demanding an end to what they called was “genocide of our khwaja sira sisters.”  According to a press release issued by the Aurat March and GIA four transgender women died in a month due to apathy of the society - two were murdered, while two died of being denied healthcare services.  The speakers said that Bijlee was a kind transgender woman who was known to be on good terms with her neighbours. Her primary source of income was begging. This week, she was strangled to death in her own house.  Toffe, was a young 19-year old transgender woman who was refused treatment at the Dr Ruth KM Pfau Civil Hospital because she was HIV-positive. She subsequently died because of denial of her basic right.  The press release said that Sherly was so aggressively discriminated against in healthcare spaces that she was terrified to seek treatment when she needed it. Unfortunately, she passed away because of our healthcare system's transphobia.  “X - she was violently murdered in Lyari. Her family doesn’t wish to disclose her name because they are still being threatened by the murderer,” the press release stated.  “These were all khwaja sira women; our sisters.

She was ignored by doctors and refused access to either the male or female wards following complaints from staff and patients. She died of her injuries on Wednesday morning.Alisha was the Peshawar coordinator and one of eight board members of Trans Action Alliance, an advocacy group that has been increasingly vocal in seeking equal rights for transgender people in the province.In Facebook posts, Trans Action said the gang that shot Alesha specifically targets members of the transgender community, and sometimes sexually assaults them while recording the crime. For an hour, while Alesha bled, doctors couldn't decide whether to admit her to the men's or women's ward, according to Trans Action. When they finally decided on the men's ward, Trans Action protested, and had her moved to the women's ward, where other women apparently complained.  Then the taunts began, Trans Action said. One doctor allegedly asked a Trans Action volunteer for her telephone number and how much she charges for a dancing party. Another was reportedly asked if her breasts were real. Another asked if the women from Trans Action just danced or also ""perform sex,"" according to the group.In July 2019 Fazal Dayan alias Fazal Gujjar was convicted of her murder and sentenced to death.

Cynthia Moreira,28.0,2018-02-22,Tucuman,Argentina,-26.8515998,-65.2119183,violence,"strangled, stabbed and dismembered","Cynthia’s decomposed and partially dismembered body was found in grassland at the back of an uninhabited house.Her body was in such a state that despite her body being found on 23rd February she was not identified until 18th April. She had been missing since 14th February. Today, after the publication of a story in the newspaper La Gaceta saying that it could be the young woman, one of Cynthia’s sisters wrote this message:  “To all our family and friends of Cynthia: the body is unrecognizable. Only a DNA test can confirm whether it is my sister. The people who took the case told me that they do not even know what Cynthia is, how can La Gaceta know?""  “We still do not know who the murdered person is. They say she’s a trans girl but we do not know. I know Cynthia, and we’re waiting for her to appear. What we do know is that the girls of Tucumán are constantly in danger. In addition to feeling the anguish that they are killing us, that friends and acquaintances die, that because we are trans we are afraid of going out into the street and sometimes of going to the center to work. I do not know if I’m going back. I am afraid and it is not a sensation, it is a reality: they are killing us, they are destroying our bodies and our lives”, Mahia Moyano, an activist with LOTO (Freedom and Pride Trans Organized), told Presentes.  **Tucumán, one of the most violent provinces**  Tucumán is one of the most violent provinces in Argentina for trans people. LOTO emerged after the travesticide of [Ayelén  perpetrated in August 2017. Her brutally murdered body was found under the stands of a sports club before a rugby match. Some time before, Ayelén had denounced police officers for raping her.  In January in Tucumán, another trans woman - [Lourdes   - was savagely murdered.  [READ ALSO: **Tucumán: a young trans and her great aunt were murdered**]   Before the wave of violence, trans people, LOTO and other organizations marched on February 7 to say enough to transvesticide and transfemicide, demand that the gender identity law is enforced, and ask for a trans work quota law.  **“We ask for Justice for all: not one trans less, live we want” **  A month later, they also marched with the slogan **Ni Una Trans Menos**. At that point the friends and family were still looking desperately for Cynthia.  [READ MORE: **March in Tucumán: “Without the trans, there is not one less**” ] One suspect was arrested in September 2019, but Cynthia's family believe others were also involved. On February 14, 2018, Cynthia Moreira , 25, left home. Five days later her body was found, dismembered, inside two bags, by a man who was performing maintenance tasks in a house on 9 de Julio 1,500, in Villa Amalia. A member of the Díaz clan was arrested for this crime, but it was always suspected that there were more involved. “We still do not have a date but the case was brought to trial with a detainee; we believe there were three more involved. We asked that Maia Amaya , a trans girl who accompanied Cynthia and whom witnesses said they saw with her between February 14 and 15, be investigated; she denies that. We believe that she is trying to cover up something or for someone, ""said Laura Moreira. The young woman added that she does not believe that Amaya did that out of fear: “she never approached my family after the crime, nor did she accompany us on the marches; in fact she made fun of certain things, which made her an unloved person among trans girls. I think she is not lying out of fear but because she was involved”. Moreira considered that it is already known who the implicated were, and that she is waiting for their capture.In September 2022 Ramón Soria was acquitted of her murder due to insufficient

Dominique Lucious,26.0,2021-04-08,Missouri,United States of America,37.2176588,-93.2987743,violence,shot,"Dominique's body was found in an apartment after she had arranged to meet a man via a dating site. Charles Nelson, 28, has been charged with her murder. A man has been charged with murder for the fatal shooting of Dominique Lucious, a 26-year-old Black trans woman from Missouri.  Charles Nelson, 28, was charged with second-degree murder and armed criminal action in connection with the killing on Thursday (8 April).  Lucious’ body was found at an apartment [in the 900 block of North Main Avenue] in Springfield, Missouri. Court documents say she’d planned to meet Nelson there on Thursday morning after connecting with him on a dating site.  Witnesses said Nelson fit the description of a man who was seen driving away from the apartment after gunshots were heard. Police used text messages from Lucious’ phone to identify and arrest him the same day.  Officers found blood on his shoes and a gun in his home that matched a shell casing found at the crime scene. Nelson is now being held in the Greene County jail without bond.  The death has devastated family and friends, who paid tribute to Dominique Lucious on Facebook. “Many don’t get to live in their authentic truth,” wrote a loved one. “You were fierce, glam, and hunny gorgeous! I love you now, tomorrow and forever.”  “Our hearts are broken for Dominique, whose bright beautiful light was extinguished far too soon, and for her family facing this horrific tragedy,” the Missouri advocacy group PROMO said in a statement.  “Everyday we work to end the stigma around transgender individuals. Such stigma fuels a culture of fear: transphobia, biphobia, and homophobia sit at the intersection of racism and misogyny, and fosters violence. ⁣⁣  “If we are not working to end the societal violence that ended Dominique’s life, we are part of the problem.”  A motive for the shooting is still unclear, but tragic incidents like these are all too common. Lucious’ death is at least the 13th violent death of a trans or gender non-conforming person in 2021, a growing problem that is likely underreported.",2021.0,Springfield,1,"[""dominique's"", 'body',

She attended university in Utah (USA), but was forced to terminate her studies and return home to China after her parents terminated her fees.After returning China, Neko lived in Shanghai until her parents found her and her father intimidated her into going back home to Yunnan with them. She finally escaped his abuse by dying by suicide several days after he forcibly enrolled her in a militarised training camp. While her friend was defending her in front of her father and suggesting sending her to a hospital in Beijing, Neko’s father beat her heavily.  Neko’s father once rudely said that her friend should not “interfere with their domestic issues” while he received Neko’s friend’s call to check her up. Her father even refused to pay the medical fee, claiming that he did not have the responsibility when Neko had medical emergencies and needed to go to the hospital.  On 16 March 2018 Neko was sent by her father to a militarized training camp, Kunming Anning Good Children Sansheng Education and Training School, which claims to provide “specialized education for those Children who are rebellious, autistic, hate school or have internet addiction disorder” with entirely closed, forceful and militarized management and strict surveillance system.  Neko sent her close friends signals for help. When her close friend tried to contact her, it transpired that Neko’s mobile phone was lost, and her parents refused to reply. Her friend said that she tried to call the police, but it did not change anything.

She had been dead for several days.Yaritza had moved from Peru to Argentina three years earlier after experiencing systemic discrimination in her birth country. She was born on December 6, 1991 in Peru and had lived in Argentina for three years. Her family heard the news last Sunday. Her mother is a housewife and her father a taxi driver. He traveled to Buenos Aires this weekend to identify her body. ""Her mother, her brother Cristian and I are very sad. My daughter was a very calm, good girl who loved little animals. We talked on the phone often, and the last time, she asked her mother, 'If something happens to me, will you take me and take care of my animals?' She said they had threatened her,"" Carlos Alberto told Presentes.  Yaritza survived through sex work. She lived with two dogs and a cat in a two-room apartment, on the eighth floor of a building in Balvanera. Her neighbors worried because they stopped seeing her and her pets were restless. Friends had a bad feeling: it was not normal for Yaritza to not answer their calls. ""They approached the building and as nobody answered, they and the neighbors decided to call 911. They also communicated with the person who rented the apartment to enter. The Homicide Division entered and found her body. She had been dead a few days without life, ""Marcela Tobaldi, coordinator of the Rosa Naranja, told Presentes.  Yaritza had approached this organization to ask for advice on the procedures to make the gender change.  ""We met sometimes,"" recalls Tobaldi. ""She started going to the Defensoría, where I work. Then we got together in La Rosa Naranja and we had some friends around to my house. She was a sweet girl, very loving. She recently called to say that her updated ID had come through.  This weekend, Tobaldi and Yaritza's friends met with the father of the victim to see how to move forward. ""I want Justice to be done,"" he said. ""At 13 or 14 we already knew who Yaritza was. I accepted her and did not want her to leave. But she wanted to make her life in her own way, that nobody told her anything, that's why she left Peru with a friend. I studied computer science and worked. My daughter finished high school, but there they all discriminated against her. In Peru it is like that,"" says the father.  For La Rosa Naranja, Tobaldi asks: ""we want the UFEM (Special Prosecutor in Violence against Women and LGBT + people) - which intervened in Diana Sacayán's transvesticide investigation - to be part of this investigation as well"" . There are strong suspicions that the crime was committed by someone who knew her. Her companions believe that she was suffocated and beaten on the head.  Tobaldi adds: ""The fact that she is a migrant must be highlighted. Justice is not the same for a poor person, trans and migrant as for a trans and middle class Argentinian. It is proven that transgender people suffer double discrimination because they are migrants and the structural and systematic discrimination that transgender people have. They suffer double.

Adrieli,28.0,2021-06-22,Latium,Italy,41.8950092,12.5692031,violence,beaten,"Adrieli's body was found with a head wound in a drainage channel. The body of a transsexual woman was found along Via Prenestina in Rome. The discovery was made earlier today, Tuesday 22 June and took place in the Quarticciolo area, near viale Palmiro Togliatti. At about 7.40 am, a report was made of a lifeless body inside a water drainage channel at street number 486, at the intersection with via Conversano, by a passerby who stopped a patrol of the Compagnia di Roma Montesacro passing through the area and requested an ambulance. The local carabinieri intervened at the scene, but unfortunately there was nothing for the woman to do except to note her death, which was confirmed by the 118 health workers who arrived by ambulance. Soldiers of the Investigative Unit of via in Selci also arrived to conduct scientific surveys and collect evidence.  The coroner and the magistrate on duty arrived on viale Palmiro Togliatti today for the first on-site checks. Those who investigated and carried out the first checks on the body found a wound on the forehead, which does not exclude any hypothesis, including murder. Subsequent post-mortem examinations will clarify the causes that led to the death. At the moment little information is known, the investigators are at work and it is not clear how the body got inside the canal, if anyone abandoned it and then left. Every hypothesis is currently being examined and the investigators are not revealing any further information but do not exclude any leads.The subsequent autopsy concluded that Adrieli was killed.If it is no longer a mystery  how  she died, now the mystery is about who killed Adrieli that night. As reported by La Repubblica  for days, the Carabinieri have been engaged in investigations: they listen to the woman's friends, other young trans girls and [sex workers] who could provide clues. However, so far there is no suspect.  Adrieli, who was of South American origin, was found on the morning of last June 22, in a canal of the Quarticciolo - a few steps from the Prenestina. The hypothesis of robbery was immediately ruled out, since the young Adrieli had twenty euros with her in her purse, but not her cell phone. Could it be that the phone contains important clues?  However, it is now the turn of the autopsy now to speak: bruises and scratches were found on her body - signs of an assault. Perhaps the young woman was attacked by her own client or by another person. The head wound - identified when the body was found - could also be consistant with a blow from a stick. In short, someone Adrieli killed her now it is up to the military to reconstruct what happened and who is responsible.

Bridget Flack,28.0,2020-12-11,Victoria,Australia,-37.78835873,145.0505159,suicide,possible suicide,"Bridget's body was found in brushland at around 5pm on Friday 11th December. She had last been seen on Monday 30th November. Victoria Police have confirmed that a body found in bushland is that of missing Melbourne woman Bridget Flack, who was reported missing two weeks ago.  Flack’s remains were found by a member of the community at Willsmere-Chandler Park in Kew East about 5pm on Friday.  The 28-year-old woman had been staying with a school friend and colleague in Carlton in the weeks before her disappearance. She told her friend she was going for a walk at the Yarra Bend Park on November 30 but never returned.  Her older sister, Angela Pucci Love, said their family was “forever indebted” to Melbourne’s LGBTIQ community and a Facebook group dedicated to finding the union worker and DJ.  “You have included us in her world without question or judgement and for that we are forever grateful,” Love posted on the group on Sunday and gave AAP permission to publish.  ‘No one on this earth deserves to feel less than worthy of an amazing life.’  “This network of amazing people ultimately led us to finding our beautiful girl and in turn meant we can put her beautiful body and soul to rest, and we too can begin to heal.”  Love said her sister’s legacy would be “just as fierce as she was”.Bridget's blog is     All of the streets around here are No Standing zones.    These pavements belong to the quick, and you move too slowly to follow.     You slink along with a chaplet of roses about your orange hair,    A sunset kaleidoscope visible only in flashes as I rush past.    Today, I turned onto an unfamiliar street to find it empty and unhurried.    Beyond the fibro houses, in among the scrub, I watched a ball of fire gently burning.    I followed at a tiptoe, and lay down in that place until I was alone again.    I am coming home with a flower tucked discreetly behind my ear.-- *""No flowers""*, by Bridget Flack",2020.0,Ivanhoe East,0,"[""bridget's"", 'body', 'was', 'found', 'in', 'brushland', 'at', 'around', '5pm', 'on', 'friday', '11th', 'december', 'she', 'had', 'last', 'been', 'seen', 'on', 'monday', '30th', 'november', 'victoria', 'police', 'have', 'confirmed', 'that', 'a', 'body', 'found', 'in', 'bushland', 'is', 'that', 'of', 'missing', 'melbourne', 'woman', 'bridget', 'flack', 'who', 'was', 'reported', 'missing', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago', 'flack', 's', 'remains', 'were', 'found', 'by', 'a', 'member', 'of', 'the', 'community', 'at', 'willsmere', 'chandler', 'park', 'in', 'kew', 'east', 'about', '5pm', 'on', 'friday', 'the', '28', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'had', 'been', 'staying', 'with', 'a', 'school', 'friend', 'and', 'colleague', 'in', 'carlton', 'in', 'the', 'weeks', 'before', 'her', 'disappearance', 'she', 'told', 'her', 'friend', 'she', 'was', 'going', 'for', 'a', 'walk', 'at', 'the', 'yarra', 'bend', 'park', 'on', 'november', '30', 'but', 'never', 'returned', 'her', 'older', 'sister', 'angela', 'pucci', 'love', 'said', 'their', 'family', 'was', 'forever', 'indebted', 'to', 'melbourne', 's', 'lgbtiq', 'community', 'and', 'a', 'facebook', 'group', 'dedicated', 'to', 'finding', 'the', 'union', 'worker', 'and', 'dj', 'you', 'have', 'included', 'us', 'in', 'her', 'world', 'without', 'question', 'or', 'judgement', 'and', 'for', 'that', 'we', 'are', 'forever', 'grateful', 'love', 'posted', 'on', 'the', 'group', 'on', 'sunday', 'and', 'gave', 'aap', 'permission', 'to', 'publish', 'no', 'one', 'on', 'this', 'earth', 'deserves', 'to', 'feel', 'less', 'than', 'worthy', 'of', 'an', 'amazing', 'life', 'this', 'network', 'of', 'amazing', 'people', 'ultimately', 'led', 'us', 'to', 'finding', 'our', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'and', 'in', 'turn', 'meant', 'we', 'can', 'put', 'her', 'beautiful', 'body', 'and', 'soul', 'to', 'rest', 'and', 'we', 'too', 'can', 'begin', 'to', 'heal', 'love', 'said', 'her', 'sister', 's', 'legacy', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'fierce', 'as', 'she', 'was', ""bridget's"", 'blog', 'is', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'streets', 'around', 'here', 'are', 'no', 'standing', 'zones', 'these', 'pavements', 'belong', 'to', 'the', 'quick', 'and', 'you', 'move', 'too', 'slowly', 'to', 'follow', 'you', 'slink', 'along', 'with', 'a', 'chaplet', 'of', 'roses', 'about', 'your', 'orange', 'hair', 'a', 'sunset', 'kaleidoscope', 'visible', 'only', 'in', 'flashes', 'as', 'i', 'rush', 'past', 'today', 'i', 'turned', 'onto', 'an', 'unfamiliar', 'street', 'to', 'find', 'it', 'empty', 'and', 'unhurried', 'beyond', 'the', 'fibro', 'houses', 'in', 'among', 'the', 'scrub', 'i', 'watched', 'a', 'ball', 'of', 'fire', 'gently', 'burning', 'i', 'followed', 'at', 'a', 'tiptoe', 'and', 'lay', 'down', 'in', 'that', 'place', 'until', 'i', 'was', 'alone', 'again', 'i', 'am', 'coming', 'home', 'with', 'a', 'flower', 'tucked', 'discreetly', 'behind', 'my', 'ear', 'no', 'flowers', 'by', 'bridget', 'flack']",bridget's body wa found in brushland at around 5pm on friday 11th december she had last been seen on monday 30th november victoria police have confirmed that a body found in bushland is that of missing melbourne woman bridget flack who wa reported missing two week ago flack s remains were found by a member of the community at willsmere chandler park in kew east about 5pm on friday the 28 year old woman had been staying with a school friend and colleague in carlton in the week before her disappearance she told her friend she wa going for a walk at the yarra bend park on november 30 but never returned her older sister angela pucci love said their family wa forever indebted to melbourne s lgbtiq community and a facebook group dedicated to finding the union worker and dj you have included u in her world without question or judgement and for that we are forever grateful love posted on the group on sunday and gave aap permission to publish no one on this earth deserves to feel le than worthy of an amazing life this network of amazing people ultimately led u to finding our beautiful girl and in turn meant we can put her beautiful body and soul to rest and we too can begin to heal love said her sister s legacy would be just a fierce a she wa bridget's blog is all of the street around here are no standing zone these pavement belong to the quick and you move too slowly to follow you slink along with a chaplet of rose about your orange hair a sunset kaleidoscope visible only in flash a i rush past today i turned onto an unfamiliar street to find it empty and unhurried beyond the fibro house in among the scrub i watched a ball of fire gently burning i followed at a tiptoe and lay down in that place until i wa alone again i am coming home with a flower tucked discreetly behind my ear no flower by bridget flack

Michelle,24.0,2019-07-19,San Luis Potosi,Mexico,22.1100648,-100.9274195,violence,tortured and shot,"Michelle's body was found after a 911 call was made on the morning of Friday 19th July. She had been executed. The General Prosecutor's Office of the State of San Luis Potosí (FGESLP) began the investigation due to the discovery of a lifeless body of a person, who at the moment is in an unknown capacity, this at the intersection of Eje 104 and calle Chichimecas of the San Luis Industrial subdivision, in the Potosí capital. The report was received minutes before 8:00 in the morning of this Friday, July 19, where notice was given about the finding of the lifeless body of a person who was in the middle of a vacant lot, where they moved elements of the General Directorate of Research Methods of the FGESLP, as well as Experts to begin with the corresponding inquiries.  The victim wore light blue denim trousers, a gray blouse and flat-soled shoes as well as a long haired wig.Local LGBT+ organisations are trying to identify the victim.  Olympia Palomo Moreno, president of the Collective for Sexual Diversity and Gender Equity A.C., said that in the case of murder of trans or transvestite girls, it is very difficult to identify the bodies.  The trans activist suggested that, given the injuries detected in the body - blows and a cut in the neck - the attack was likely a hate crime, reinforced by homophobic comments on social networks.  ""Religion is an absurd burden and leads to this. These are the consequences, that a 24-year-old person, who did not owe or fear it, ended up this way and the truth is not fair. Hopefully the Prosecutor's Office can clarify the crime as soon as possible, as it has done with others, ""he said.  In addition, Paul Ibarra Collazo, director of Red Diversificados Sociales A.C., lamented the murder of the alleged [trans woman], which is at a time when the LGBTTTIQ community has gained access to various rights.  ""We are worried because it just happens in a season that certain rights have been accessed, that there has been some openness and that, in addition, there have been very strong manifestations of hate, by parts of certain groups,"" he emphasized.",2019.0,San Luis Potosi,1,"[""michelle's"", 'body', 'was', 'found', 'after', 'a', '911', 'call', 'was', 'made', 'on', 'the', 'morning', 'of',

This is [deadname] Díaz Ramírez, whom they called Penelope. There is no longer any doubt, this is an epidemic of anti-LGBTTIQ violence. The Police have the obligation to disclose the status of the investigations of at least eight murders, one death without a specific cause and several attacks in which LGBTTIQ people have been injured since January 2019, ”said Pedro Julio Serrano, CABE spokesman. Charges for murder and destruction of evidence were filed today against José Villafañe Cotto, 32, for events that occurred at the Correctional Complex in Bayamón, police reported. The inmate confessed that in the night hours of last April 13, in cell 29, of building 5, section A-5, he used a piece of cloth to strangle [deadname] Díaz Ramírez, 31 years old. Later, he destroyed the evidence used to commit the crime.Penelope's murder took place in the same week that the bodies of [Serena Angelique  and [Layla Pelaez  were found inside a burnt out car in Humacao - less than 50km away. A third transgender woman was killed this week in Puerto Rico, part of an ongoing “epidemic of violence” targeting the LGBTQ community. At least nine people have been killed since January 2019. The bodies of two transgender women were found inside a badly burned car earlier this week. There is no longer any doubt, this is an epidemic of anti-LGBT+ violence,” activist Pedro Julio Serrano said. “The police have the obligation to disclose the status of the investigations of at least eight murders, one death without a determined cause, and several attacks in which LGBTQ people have been injured since January 2019.” Penélope Díaz Ramírez was killed on April 13. Her death was not reported until now. The two other victims as Layla Peláez and Serena Angelique Velázquez Ramos by local activists.

Transgender people do not deserve to die. Every single advocate, ally, elected official, and community member must stand up in light of this horrific news and say ‘No more.’ What we are doing is not enough.” “Transgender and gender non-conforming people, especially women of color,” she added, “are too often the victims of a toxic mix of transphobia, racism, and misogyny.” “They are hunting us,” Serrano

An incident involving six people was registered on the night of this Monday (17), in the Industrial City of Curitiba (CIC). A truck driver who was a resident of the Sítio Cercado neighborhood was surprised by two suspects as he was starting a trip to São Paulo. According to information, two other trans people participated in the crime and a gunman wounded at least three people.  The result of the incident was: a 25-year-old trans woman dead; another arrested; two suspects shot and under observation at the hospital; a gunman who surrendered to the police station; and the victim, the truck driver.  The incident took place on Rua Juscelino Kubistchek, on the Contorno Sul waterfront, at CIC. The truck driver was heading towards a gas station, before continuing on to São Paulo, with a load of wine. However, as he was passing along the area, he was approached by two suspects. The truck driver stopped the vehicle and placed the truck at the disposal of the men. Soon after, two trans women entered the cabin of the truck and attempted to rob him.   The victim surrendered to the robbery, losing cell phone and cards to the suspects. However, shots were heard shortly thereafter. A gunman had passed the scene, saw what was happening and started shooting.  One of the trans women was shot and did not survive. The two men accompanying the crime were also injured and sent for treatment. The other trans woman was not shot and was arrested.  A man later surrendered to the police station and confessed to being the shooter. According to extra official information, the boy declared that he was also the victim of the suspects.

Tayda Lebón,28.0,2021-10-14,New Jersey,United States of America,40.6451594,-74.0850817,suicide,suicide,"Tayda was an artist and musician. She died by suicide, reportedly after being thrown out of her home by her mother, who did not accept her transition. On Thursday, the tragic death of Tayda, the daughter of David Lebón, the Argentine rock guitarist musician, was announced. The news was communicated by the panelist Franco Torchia, who had contact with her and shocked everyone, but the stupor grew in the last hours because it transpired that he had committed suicide after a bad family moment.  ""Tayda Lebón died in New York, where she had lived for many years. She was an artist at all times, intelligent at full volume and the architect of her own survival. Daughter of David Lebón. She had been asking for help for months. Even without further details. Much sadness"" , wrote the journalist in a social network post. Minutes later, the same journalist gave a shocking detail in another tweet: ""Tayda committed suicide,"" he detailed.  Tayda was an artist who, like her father, chose music and later settled in the United States to live as a tattoo artist. By then she had chosen to be a trans woman.  An artist, musician and tattoo artist, she came to New York in the mid-2000s, the city where her mother Liliana lived, trying to escape the label that the media imposed on her as 'daughter of'. ""I wanted to go to a place where nobody knew me and that what I managed to do was for myself,"" she said in an interview with La Nación in 2017.  But there his life was not easy either, since family problems appeared. “Having the family that I have, I imagined that my transition was going to be much easier, that I was going to be a good example for other families, because it is good to have the positive stories of people who were able to make a transition with the support of his family. There are a lot of people who are that lucky. ""  ""With my family, I thought I was going to be a good example. But hey, one is constantly surprised by things: half of my family did not like it. They did not write or say anything to me. I have been very surprised by many people I know that, possibly, I do not feel that they support me , ”Tayda said, without specifically mentioning her mother, who was the one who had not accepted her transition.  Tayda rented an apartment in a complex owned by her mother's husband, and she lived one floor above where they lived. According to what they say, David's daughter said she felt trapped, judged, insulted and manipulated by her mother.  Torchia had also publicly told a few years ago that Liliana not only did not accept her daughter's changes, but that she had thrown her out of her house. However, despite the distance her father was a great pillar for her and with her all the way.Tayda had transitioned in 2017. She had a great relationship with her father, but not with her mother. Tayda was a tattoo artist and also a musician, like her father and mother, Lili Lagarde. In 2017, she decided to finally begin the process to transform her body by perceiving herself as a woman and defining herself as pansexual. As she had commented in an interview, she had always considered herself a woman.  In another interview, she expressed his affection for her father. "" My dad was, is and will be my best friend. With his strengths and weaknesses, as we all have. I am who I am thanks to him. I can be free because I have been allowed to be free. And that is something that I never lacked from my dad. I feel loved, always listened to. He is proud of me. Respect is what I learned from him. Tanguito was not stupid. Love is stronger! The rest is bullshit. ""  However, she had publicly stated that she did not have a good relationship with her mother, who like her lived in New York. On the Facebook page of Abolitionist Transfeminism, a post by Tayda was found which suggested that things had not been going well for her for months.Tayda's Facebook, Instagram and Twitter profiles

Sherin Celin Mathew,26.0,2022-05-17,Kerala,India,9.9897354,76.3132072,suicide,suicide,"Sherin died by suicide. Sherin Celin Mathew, a 26-year-old trans woman from Kerala, who was an actor and model, was found dead in a rented apartment at Chakkaraparambu in Kochi, on Tuesday, May 17. She was from the neighbouring Alappuzha district and had been staying here for two years. The news comes merely days after the death of another Kerala model, Sahana.  Sherin was reportedly suffering from depression due to some personal differences with a few of her friends. A police officer said a case of unnatural death has been registered and prima facie it appeared to be a suicide, and that a detailed probe was going on. Speaking to TNM, police said that investigation is underway at the scene and her body will be sent for a postmortem soon.  On May 12, Sahana, a young model and small-time actor from Kozhikode, was found dead in her house on her 21st birthday in an apparent case of suicide. In July 2021, Kerala’s first transgender radio jockey [Anannyah Kumari  was also believed to have died by suicide, days after she had alleged gross medical negligence in her sex reassignment surgery. After her friends and family protested against the hospital – Renai Medicity – and Dr Arjun Asokan, who did the surgery, Kerala Health Minister Veena George ordered a probe into Anannyah’s death.  Recently in April, a fact-finding report on her death alleged gross medical negligence by the private hospital and sought better healthcare for trans persons in the state, and for medical professionals to follow international norms. The fact-finding team has also asked for a second post-mortem of Anannyah’s body, and has said that the police investigation into the death was shoddy.",2022.0,Cochin,0,"['sherin', 'died', 'by', 'suicide', 'sherin', 'celin', 'mathew', 'a', '26', 'year', 'old', 'trans', 'woman', 'from', 'kerala', 'who', 'was', 'an', 'actor', 'and', 'model', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'in', 'a', 'rented', 'apartment', 'at', 'chakkaraparambu', 'in', 'kochi', 'on', 'tuesday', 'may', '17', 'she', 'was', 'from', 'the', 'neighbouring', 'alappuzha', 'district', 'and', 'had', 'been', 'staying', 'here', 'for', 'two', 'years', 'the', 'news', 'comes', 'merely', 'days', 'after', 'the', 'death', 'of', 'another', 'kerala', 'model', 'sahana', 'sherin', 'was', 'reportedly', 'suffering', 'from', 'depression', 'due', 'to', 'some', 'personal', 'differences', 'with', 'a', 'few', 'of', 'her', 'friends', 'a', 'police', 'officer', 'said', 'a', 'case', 'of', 'unnatural', 'death', 'has', 'been', 'registered', 'and', 'prima', 'facie', 'it', 'appeared', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'suicide', 'and', 'that', 'a', 'detailed', 'probe', 'was', 'going', 'on', 'speaking', 'to', 'tnm', 'police', 'said', 'that', 'investigation', 'is', 'underway', 'at', 'the', 'scene', 'and', 'her', 'body', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'for', 'a', 'postmortem', 'soon', 'on', 'may', '12', 'sahana', 'a', 'young', 'model', 'and', 'small', 'time', 'actor', 'from', 'kozhikode', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'in', 'her', 'house', 'on', 'her', '21st', 'birthday', 'in', 'an', 'apparent', 'case', 'of', 'suicide', 'in', 'july', '2021', 'kerala', 's', 'first', 'transgender', 'radio', 'jockey', 'anannyah', 'kumari', 'was', 'also', 'believed', 'to', 'have', 'died', 'by', 'suicide', 'days', 'after', 'she', 'had', 'alleged', 'gross', 'medical', 'negligence', 'in', 'her', 'sex', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'after', 'her', 'friends', 'and', 'family', 'protested', 'against', 'the', 'hospital', 'renai', 'medicity', 'and', 'dr', 'arjun', 'asokan', 'who', 'did', 'the', 'surgery', 'kerala', 'health', 'minister', 'veena', 'george', 'ordered', 'a', 'probe', 'into', 'anannyah', 's', 'death', 'recently', 'in', 'april', 'a', 'fact', 'finding', 'report', 'on', 'her', 'death', 'alleged', 'gross', 'medical', 'negligence', 'by', 'the', 'private', 'hospital', 'and', 'sought', 'better', 'healthcare', 'for', 'trans', 'persons', 'in', 'the', 'state', 'and', 'for', 'medical', 'professionals', 'to', 'follow', 'international', 'norms', 'the', 'fact', 'finding', 'team', 'has', 'also', 'asked', 'for', 'a', 'second', 'post', 'mortem', 'of', 'anannyah', 's', 'body', 'and', 'has', 'said', 'that', 'the', 'police', 'investigation', 'into', 'the', 'death', 'was', 'shoddy']",sherin died by suicide sherin celin mathew a 26 year old trans woman from kerala who wa an actor and model wa found dead in a rented apartment at chakkaraparambu in kochi on tuesday may 17 she wa from the neighbouring alappuzha district and had been staying here for two year the news come merely day after the death of another kerala model sahana sherin wa reportedly suffering from depression due to some personal difference with a few of her friend a police officer said a case of unnatural death ha been registered and prima facie it appeared to be a suicide and that a detailed probe wa going on speaking to tnm police said that investigation is underway at the scene and her body will be sent for a postmortem soon on may 12 sahana a young model and small time actor from kozhikode wa found dead in her house on her 21st birthday in an apparent case of suicide in july 2021 kerala s first transgender radio jockey anannyah kumari wa also believed to have died by suicide day after she had alleged gross medical negligence in her sex reassignment surgery after her friend and family protested against the hospital renai medicity and dr arjun asokan who did the surgery kerala health minister veena george ordered a probe into anannyah s death recently in april a fact finding report on her death alleged gross medical negligence by the private hospital and sought better healthcare for trans person in the state and for medical professional to follow international norm the fact finding team ha also asked for a second post mortem of anannyah s body and ha said that the police investigation into the death wa shoddy

Gianna Lombardi,48.0,2021-01-18,Apulia,Italy,41.227674,16.294755,uncategorised,not reported,"Gianna lived in poverty, in a home without heating or light. After she died her birth family tried to quietly erase her identity, but news of her death went viral in Italy. A case of transphobia in the city of Andria where Gianna died, a transgender person who is remembered by her family on funeral posters with a man's name, which we will not repeat. The first to denounce the gesture was Vladimir Luxuria through a  telling what happened with the commitment and disdain for the new case of transphobia that took place in Puglia. Luxuria wrote: ""A transgender person, Gianna, indigent and discarded by society, dies in Andria. The family decides to put up funeral posters with his male name (which I prefer not to repeat). An offense to the name and identity with which everyone knew her"".  Riccardo Pirrone, SMM of Taffo Funeral Services replied to Vladimir. Taffo is a funeral agency known for its ability to comment on reality with irony, and he offered to redo the posters and spread them virally on the net, in response to the transphobic actions [of Gianna's birth family].Gianna was desperately poor and had never been accepted by her family. Vladamir had met her some time before during a discussion about civil rights and transphobia in the city. Among the voices that of Gianna rose, remembered by Luxuria to the Messenger with sincere condolences: “As she spoke it was clear to everyone that she no longer wanted to be insulted. She asked for a hearing, a council house. I was struck by the dignity of her person, that which does not depend on social class or gender identity - it is something much deeper, like those eyes of her mixed with rimmel and tears. After the debate I wanted to get to know her better, I realized she was a person who had been through all sorts of things. Feeling rejected by everyone, she had found refuge in alcohol and today, unfortunately, I received the news of her death and also of these absurd funeral posters. I wanted to testify to my closeness to a person ""discriminated against by the square"". Because of her [gender identity] but also because one cannot live in a house without heating or electricity, concluded Vladimir.Funeral home staff themselves are fed up with birth families treating deceased trans people in this way: Among the thousands of comments on Taffo's post  who shared the correct version of the manifesto on his page, the comment of a fellow citizen stands out who confirms: ""I'm from Andria, I knew and saw her every day. Working in a funeral home before, I talked to my former colleagues and they too had problems making condolence posters because the family wanted everything in a male name. Unfortunately her family has never accepted her ... and it is precisely for this reason that she suffered"". ""Using her male name is an offense to the identity with which everyone knew her"": this is how  decided to offer her enormous media exposure for the final, and most respectful, greeting to GIANNA, the transgender person of Andria passed away in recent days apparently due to an accidental fall on which investigations are still underway by the Carabinieri. Gianna, a transgender person, died in Andria, destitute because they were discarded by society. The family decided to put up funeral posters with her male name - which was an insult to the name and identity by which everyone knew her. We decided to remake the funeral poster to give her a respectful last farewell. The ceremony will take place today Wednesday January 20th at 16:00 pm at Parrocchia San Riccardo in Andria.

When her family learnt of her death several days later transphobia by officials made it difficult to get her body released for burial. A [trans woman] who had been missing for four days was found dead by relatives at the Instituto Médico Legal (IML) in Belo Horizonte on Sunday (31).  Information shows that Michele Almeida, 45, was stabbed to death under a viaduct in the capital of Minas Gerais. Michele was a student at Transvest, an NGO coordinated by city councilwoman Duda Salabert that aims to combat transphobia and facilitate the inclusion of transgender people in society.   According to the councilwoman, Michele's death may have been related to her marginalization.  ""According to reports, 77% of murders of [trans people] in Brazil take place with exaggerated violence, exquisite cruelty, and she was possibly murdered doing [sex work]. Because of society's prejudice about 90% of [trans women] in Brazil are unfortunately [sex workers]. That is why it is important for us to fight for the employability of [trans people] people as a way to combat this structural hatred"", she explained.  Duda Salabert said she will file a formal complaint with the Civil Police, demanding further investigations into the crime against Michele Almeida. Michele Almeida, my colleague and student of the @ongtransvest. Stabbing her in the neck ... She was a calm and sweet trans. The stab tore across her neck.

"Reyna Fernandez Villanueva (""Reira Saga"")",27.0,2021-05-10,Loreto,Peru,-4.5070796,-73.57449,violence,stabbed,"Reyna was stabbed in the store where she worked. Red Trans de Loreto, repudiates the murder of a [trans woman] in the city of Nauta. It classifies the savage act as a hate crime and orders the authorities that administer justice to punish the murderer, in the shortest possible time, with the full weight of the law. It also ensures that this murder confirms the intolerance of this society towards LGBTI populations.  At dawn on May 10, the murder of 27-year-old [deadname] Fernández Villanueva, known in trans society by the name of Reina, was reported. The act of blood occurred inside the company ""Multiservicios Favicel"", located in the La Casona shopping center, in the center of the city of Nauta.  The police authorities together with the representatives of the Public Ministry of the jurisdiction, showed that the body of the young trans woman was cruelly stabbed which led to her death.  Carol Carlobi Ríos - President of the Trans Network of Loreto, representing her organization, was outraged by the cruel murder of Reina for what she classifies as a hate crime. ""... from the network after we want to express our total repudiation, we demand that the person or persons responsible for such a deplorable act be investigated in a free manner and punished.  Likewise, Carlobi did not hesitate to accuse that this murder could be a reflection of the type of society in which we live. ""... one more trans death and this can attest once again to the hatred or cruelty towards trans people.""  Finally, Carol urged the media to respect gender identity. ""...

Joice Freitas Vieira,32.0,2014-01-28,Para,Brazil,-1.292703,-47.92239,violence,stabbed,"Joice was stabbed to death in a room of the Palace motel located alongside the PA-136 road connecting Castanhal to Curuçá.The police investigated the crime as a possible hate crime as this is the second stabbing of a trans person under similar circumstances within a month (see  for the previous case). The Civil Police, through the Homicide Office, investigate a crime in Castanhal, northeast of Pará, where a trans woman was stabbed to death inside a motel. Police have not dismissed the possibility of homophobic crime, as it is the second trans woman stabbed to death in less than a month.  The crime happened in room 13 of the Palace motel, located on the banks of the PA-136, road connecting Castanhal to Curuçá. According to the Civil Police, the murderer took a taxi from near the police station in downtown Castanhal and asked the taxi driver to go to BR-316, near Cosanpa, to pick up a trans sex worker. The driver followed the instructions of the passenger, and when he arrived at the place indicated, was asked: ""Which of these do you want me to take?"", referring to the trans sex workers waiting for custom.  As he had no response from the taxi driver, the killer chose, according to police, randomly the nearest trans woman. ""It's one more line of investigation we're having because, according to information from the taxi driver, the killer still asked who he should take. But the taxi driver was impartial and so the killer took the first one who approached the car"", said the delegate Temmer Khayat.   ""According to the taxi driver, the victim charged R $50.00 for her services, which was accepted by the murderer. When he arrived at the motel, the victim entered the room while the suspect paid for the taxi"", Khayat said.  After entering the room, the victim, identified as Joice, was violently attacked from behind. The killer stabbed her several times without giving her any defend herself, and she died at the scene. ""By the time they got to the motel, and by the time he ran away, as the images on the CCTV show, it appears that they did not have sex. He was only there to kill the victim, "". This was the second murder of a trans woman in Castanhal in less than a month. On December 29, another tran woman, who worked in the same place as Joice was also stabbed to death. The Civil Police has not ruled out a connection between the two crimes, but believes that it also has other lines of investigation.  ""We do not rule out a homophobic crime, since the deaths are very close and they were similar, except that the former was still stabbed to death and the second to the motel. We are investigating the circumstances of the crime and we are going to analyze the images of the CCTV of the motel. We will also listen once more to the taxi driver to give details of the killer, as well as the owner of the property. The investigations continue and we do not rule out any hypothesis for the crime, such as revenge and reckoning, since the victim committed robberies there"", concluded Deputy Temmer

The perpetrator - his brother - was shot dead at the scene by police. A victim of the Ohio mass shooting and sibling of the shooter, Jordan Cofer, has been revealed to be a transgender man by friends who say he has been deadnamed by the media. The 22-year-old was among nine people killed in the attack in Dayton, Ohio on Sunday (August 4), but has been widely misgendered and deadnamed by police and the media. He has been labelled as the “sister” of Connor Bretts, the perpetrator of the tragedy. A close friend of Cofer’s told Splinter over Twitter DM that he actually identified as a transgender man. “Jordan was my closest friend,” the anonymous friend said. “He identified with he/him pronouns to people he trusted and knew would support him. Jordan was probably one of the sweetest people you would ever meet, a true saint, but he was also very scared constantly. He tried to give the best to everyone.” According to his friend, Cofer was not out to his family, including his brother. Cofer was one of the first of his brother’s victims.

Madden’s death was ruled a homicide by the Tarrant County Medical  Investigators are not releasing much information surrounding the incident. No motive or suspect information has been made public. The lead investigator on the case has not returned numerous calls over several weeks. Madden grew up in Longview and attended the University of Texas at Arlington, according to her obituary. She attended services at the Potter’s House of Dallas regularly. The Rev. Carmarion Anderson, who is also trans, said she met Madden about 10 years ago through a mutual family member. She said she had a passion for living free and was a spiritual person, often saying that “living her ‘truth’ was the appropriate way to display the Love of Christ provided to humanity.” Madden’s death was heartbreaking for Anderson, who said she was even more upset by the way her death has been handled by authorities. “I am more challenged regarding how her murder has been handled by the authorities with no active actions being taken for due-justice,” she said. “As a transgender individual, activist and minister of the gospel, I am very concerned about the increase in deaths due to violence in the transgender community at-large.”",2013.0,Savannah,1,"['konyale', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'in', 'her', 'home', 'from', 'a', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'to', 'the', 'neck', 'savannah', 'denton', 'county', 'investigators', 'with', 'the', 'denton', 'county', 'sheriff', 's', 'office', 'have', 'few', 'answers', 'about', 'the', 'death', 'of', 'transgender', 'woman', 'artegus', 'konyale', 'madden', 'madden', '34', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'in', 'her', 'home', 'on', 'hayden', 'lane', 'in', 'savannah', 'estates', 'by', 'friends', 'on', 'sept', '1', 'savannah', 'is', 'a', 'small', 'town', 'east', 'of', 'denton', 'madden', 's', 'death', 'was', 'ruled', 'a', 'homicide', 'by', 'the', 'tarrant', 'county', 'medical', 'investigators', 'are', 'not', 'releasing', 'much', 'information', 'surrounding', 'the', 'incident', 'no', 'motive', 'or', 'suspect', 'information', 'has', 'been', 'made', 'public', 'the', 'lead', 'investigator', 'on', 'the', 'case', 'has', 'not', 'returned', 'numerous', 'calls', 'over', 'several', 'weeks', 'madden', 'grew', 'up', 'in', 'longview', 'and', 'attended', 'the', 'university', 'of', 'texas', 'at', 'arlington', 'according', 'to', 'her', 'obituary', 'she', 'attended', 'services', 'at', 'the', 'potter', 's', 'house', 'of', 'dallas', 'regularly', 'the', 'rev', 'carmarion', 'anderson', 'who', 'is', 'also', 'trans', 'said', 'she', 'met', 'madden', 'about', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'through', 'a', 'mutual', 'family', 'member', 'she', 'said', 'she', 'had', 'a', 'passion', 'for', 'living', 'free', 'and', 'was', 'a', 'spiritual', 'person', 'often', 'saying', 'that', 'living', 'her', 'truth', 'was', 'the', 'appropriate', 'way', 'to', 'display', 'the', 'love', 'of', 'christ', 'provided', 'to', 'humanity', 'madden', 's', 'death', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'for', 'anderson', 'who', 'said', 'she', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'upset', 'by', 'the', 'way', 'her', 'death', 'has', 'been', 'handled', 'by', 'authorities', 'i', 'am', 'more', 'challenged', 'regarding', 'how', 'her', 'murder', 'has', 'been', 'handled', 'by', 'the', 'authorities', 'with', 'no', 'active', 'actions', 'being', 'taken', 'for', 'due', 'justice', 'she', 'said', 'as', 'a', 'transgender', 'individual', 'activist', 'and', 'minister', 'of', 'the', 'gospel', 'i', 'am', 'very', 'concerned', 'about', 'the', 'increase', 'in', 'deaths', 'due', 'to', 'violence', 'in', 'the', 'transgender', 'community', 'at', 'large']",konyale wa found dead in her home from a gunshot wound to the neck savannah denton county investigator with the denton county sheriff s office have few answer about the death of transgender woman artegus konyale madden madden 34 wa found dead in her home on hayden lane in savannah estate by friend on sept 1 savannah is a small town east of denton madden s death wa ruled a homicide by the tarrant county medical investigator are not releasing much information surrounding the incident no motive or suspect information ha been made public the lead investigator on the case ha not returned numerous call over several week madden grew up in longview and attended the university of texas at arlington according to her obituary she attended service at the potter s house of dallas regularly the rev carmarion anderson who is also trans said she met madden about 10 year ago through a mutual family member she said she had a passion for living free and wa a spiritual person often saying that living her truth wa the appropriate way to display the love of christ provided to humanity madden s death wa heartbreaking for anderson who said she wa even more upset by the way her death ha been handled by authority i am more challenged regarding how her murder ha been handled by the authority with no active action being taken for due justice she said a a transgender individual activist and minister of the gospel i am very concerned about the increase in death due to violence in the transgender community at large

Zella Ziona,21.0,2015-10-15,Maryland,United States of America,39.142187,-77.193402,violence,shot,"Zella was shot several times by Rico LeBlond, 22, in an alley behind the Lakeforest Mall in Gaithersburg. She was found with gunshot wounds to the head and groin areas.In July 2017 Rico LeBlond was convicted of first-degree murder. However, a mistrial was later declared and it was not until September 2020 that LeBlond was sentenced to 35 years in prison.Montgomery County police said in charging documents at the time that LeBlond and Ziona had been friends since their school days, and that LeBlond had become upset when people found out about their friendship. Rico Leblond, the man who last month admitted to killing a transgender woman in 2015, received a sentence Tuesday afternoon that amounts to 35 years in prison. It was the maximum sentence prosecutors sought under last month’s plea deal. Tuesday’s hearing ends a first-degree murder case that continued through two trials, as well as a Maryland Court of Appeals ruling that overturned Leblond’s conviction in the second trial. Zella Ziona was killed in an alley behind Gaithersburg’s Lakeforest Mall in October 2015. The 21-year-old victim and Leblond had known each other since middle school. Authorities had once believed Leblond was embarrassed when Ziona flirted with him, but they later said the motive was a gang turf dispute.

Walters, 16, was arrested on charges of second degree murder. A Rochester teen accused of fatally stabbing Fatima Woods last month pleaded not guilty Thursday morning in City Court. Vincent A. Walters, 16, of Driving Park, is facing one count of second-degree murder in connection with the slaying that occurred outside a Dewey Avenue gas station about 4 a.m. on May 30. Woods, 53, who is transgender, was stabbed twice in the torso, and was found by police found by police near the entrance to the gas station's convenience store, 780 Dewey. Woods was taken to Strong Memorial Hospital and was pronounced dead within the hour, according to City Court documents. Rochester Police Chief James Sheppard said it appeared that just before the slaying, Woods was involved in a dispute with a woman on Finch Street.

Luo,21.0,2022-03-09,Hubei,China,30.611823,114.2561293,violence,stabbed,"Luo was stabbed to death in a restroom in the mall where she worked. The authorities attempted to suppress news of her murder. On March 9, the murder of a transgender person took place in Wuhan Paradise Walk, a large shopping center in downtown Wuhan. The victim was a transgender woman, who was killed in the afternoon with a knife by a man while she was using the men’s restroom in accordance with her biological sex.  The picture of the crime circulating on the Internet shows that the deceased was wearing women’s clothes and knee-high boots. Her clothes had been stripped off when she fell to the ground, so many netizens thought the deceased was a woman when the news first came out.  But soon the police preliminary notification which spread on Weibo revealed that the murder was committed with a knife at 3 p.m. on March 9 in the men’s restroom on the 4th floor of Paradise Walk. The 19-year-old male suspect Zhang and the 21-year-old victim Luo did not know each other before. They started a verbal dispute, resulting in a bloody violent clash. The victim died on the spot.  The police notification was issued at 5:30 p.m., and stated that Luo was [a trans woman] and an employee of a restaurant in the Paradise Walk. So many netizens understood that the deceased was a transgender woman who was using the men’s restroom based on her biological sex, and speculated that it was probably a hate crime born out of transphobia.   After the incident, Weibo users condemned the killer and debated the issue of transgender rights in China. Some netizens posted posters calling attention to hate crimes against transgender people in China.  However, the discussion was immediately suppressed by the authorities’ Internet control department. Topics such as “Wuhan Paradise Walk murder case,” “Wuhan Paradise Walk murder,” and even simply “Wuhan Paradise Walk” were blocked. Netizens were confronted with a message that, “According to relevant laws, regulations and policies, the topic page is not displayed.”   A transgender blogger named who had tried to generate attention for the case on Weibo, also deleted her earlier Weibo post exposing the incident, claiming that she had received a phone call from Wuhan police. “Because the suspect’s behavior was too bad and the scene was very bloody, and the suspect has been caught on the spot and is being interrogated about the motive of the crime, so to avoid the impact on the victim’s family, as well as not to affect the police investigation work, I deleted that previous microblogging, please wait patiently for the police notice,” [she] said in the comment section of Weibo.  She also posted, “Please wait patiently for the police notice, the final case results will also be posted simultaneously on the magistrate’s office site.” But at the time of this writing, Wuhan police still had not made any public statements on the matter, and the official Weibo page of Wuhan Paradise Walk had not been updated since 5:32 p.m. on March 9th.   Bitter Winter has also received reports from several Wuhan residents being warned by police over the phone to delete their posts with videos and pictures related to this murder. Police threatened them with legal consequences if they did not remove the posts about the homicide.  Chinese trans get killed,media suppress the discuss.

"Johana Medina León (""Joa"")",25.0,2019-06-01,New Mexico,United States of America,31.8775349,-106.6385462,custodial,died in custody,"Joa was a detained Salvadorian asylum seeker. She had been asking for medical help for nearly 2 months, but ICE only took her to hospital after she lost consciousness.Grecia, a trans activist from Casa Migrante in Juarez, Mexico who accompanied Joa until the end said the following: ""Her name was Johana Medina, known to her friends as Joa. She was in ICE detention for two months in a New Mexico facility. For weeks she pleaded for medical help, referring to health problems caused by complications with HIV/AIDS.  After two months of suffering, Joana became extremely ill and unconscious forcing ICE to take her to Las Palmas del Sol Hospital in El Paso, Texas. This morning I went to visit her at the hospital intensive care unit. When I looked at her I said that what happened a year ago to  in the month of May could happen to Joa right in there.  And it did. Unfortunately today at 21:00 hrs I got called by the hospital to tell me that she had passed away... ¨[Diversidad Sin  issued the following statement:  “We regret to inform the community that ICE has taken one more of our sisters. Johana Medina aka Joa, a Salvadoran trans woman has died in ICE custody in a hospital of El Paso, Tx yesterday at 21:00.”  “We’re seen as people that aren’t part of society. Like we’re a disease. Inhuman.”said the five trans asylum seekers interviewed by the San Antonio Express-News who are in or recently released from the Pearsall detention center.  Joa is the 23rd person overall and the second trans person to die while in ICE custody according to an NBC report dated Jan 6th 2019. Most like Roxana Hernández have died due to the Trump administration’s uncaring erratic detention policies. Adding insult to injury many and have suffered continuing inhumanities as the Government lies about and tries to hide their deaths.  We will update when more information becomes available.  Rest in Power Joa.Later the same day a friend issued the following update: This the latest info I have gathered from family and friends regarding Joa's passing in ICE detention. Dates are approximate and they are gathered from phone convos:  Before April 11th: She had been waiting for her number #7326 to come up for her to present legally to seek asylum. She waited nearly three months in Juarez.  April 11th: She presented to CBP in El Paso, Tx. According to testimonies from her boyfriend and other trans women present: ""she was told she was not trans"", that ""she was a man."" Unlike her other comrades, she was not paroled out but sent to Otero County Processing Center.  May 21st: She calls her boyfriend to El Salvador telling him that she is not feeling well. She tells him she misses him and that was the last time he spoke to her.  From April 11th to May 23rd or 24th: Her health deteriorated. In El Salvador she was a certified nurse so she knew she was unable to take medication orally and in repetitive occasions she told ICE officers she needed an (IV) solution, that she could do it herself but she just needed the medication.  May 23th-25th: ICE decides to take her to the hospital after she appears to be unconscious. According to family members, she was granted release on recognizance the day she was dropped off at the hospital.  June 1st: Her uncle and Grecia, a trans leader from Juarez are notified Joa has passed away in Las Palmas del Sol hospital at 9:05pm.  She was loved by all of her family including her grandma the main reason for her to travel thousands of miles to be detained in inhumane conditions. She was unable to practice her nursing profession as an open trans woman so her dream was to come to the US to get certified and make a living healing people.  We send condolences to her partner, family, and friends.Subsequently it emerged that ICE had deliberately withheld even basic medical care. Medina León, who worked as a nurse in El Salvador, recognized that she needed IV fluids, but was denied. When she asked for water, sugar and salt so she could make her own IV, Ice also refused, the claim said. The treatment in Ice custody was so bad that Medina León, who was fleeing violence in her home country, requested to be deported so she could get medical attention, lawyers said. That request was also denied. “She came to the US because she thought it was a great country and that she would be safe there,” her 22-year-old sister, Gabriela León, said in an email to the Guardian, sent by her lawyer. “She did everything right but was treated as a criminal … She shouldn’t have died. She went to the US seeking protection and now she is coming home to us dead.”  Christopher Dolan, an attorney who filed the claim, added: “She was desperate, because the government would not provide her with assistance of any kind for her medical needs.”",2019.0,Santa Teresa,0,"['joa', 'was', 'a', 'detained', 'salvadorian', 'asylum', 'seeker', 'she', 'had', 'been', 'asking', 'for', 'medical',

Name Unknown,28.0,2021-03-08,Parana,Brazil,-25.44281,-49.059792,violence,stabbed,"The victim was killed at the behest of a drug dealer to prevent her reporting the dealer to the police. A debt of R $ 5,000 led a drug user to kill a [trans woman] in Piraquara, in the metropolitan region of Curitiba (RMC). According to the Civil Police, the crime occurred at the behest of a drug dealer, since the victim intended to report her for trafficking to the police. Both were arrested and investigations into the case were concluded on Wednesday (10).  The investigation began after the family informed the police that the victim disappeared last Friday (5). “I had just arrested the woman in the act, for trafficking. So, I was on duty at the Central de Flagrantes in the metropolitan region and I knew that there was this police report (BO) talking about her disappearance”, said delegate Nasser Salmen to Banda B.  Three days later, on Monday (8), the body of the [trans woman] was found. The delegate said that the [trans woman] was killed with about 10 to 12 stab wounds. This, therefore, was the way that the principal of the crime found to “forgive” the user for the value of the narcotics he bought.  “The drug dealer, aware of the debt and possible complaint, asked the user to commit the murder.

Haven A Bailey,25.0,2021-05-24,Illinois,United States of America,41.8879067,-88.0157129,suicide,suicide,"Haven was shot dead by police in what appears to have been a ""suicide by cop"" incident. A trans man carrying a pellet gun was fatally shot by a police officer in Villa Park, Illinois. Police named Haven A Bailey as the victim and confirmed that the shooting happened in the early hours of Monday (24 May).  Officers were responding to a call of a person with a gun in the area of 200 East Kenilworth Avenue in Villa Park, Illinois – a village within the Chicago metropolitan area.  After arriving on the scene, officers said they encountered a person walking “directly toward them while armed” with what they believed was a handgun. Police said Bailey was told to “drop the gun several times”. An officer then “shot the person four times when they refused”.  Officials said they later recovered a “black pellet gun made to look like a Sig Sauer 1911 pistol”.  Police reportedly began life-saving measures at the scene, and Bailey was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital where he later died from his injuries.  A preliminary investigation revealed Bailey “made the initial 911 call to report the person with a gun in the street”. The Villa Park Police added the investigation is still ongoing.  Bailey’s family told WGN TV that he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder and was struggling with alcohol addiction. They also confirmed he was a trans man, after he was misgendered by a police statement on Facebook.  WGN TV reported that Bailey was supported to enrol in a treatment centre for alcoholism, but he rented a room at a halfway house he found on Facebook. He was at the halfway house when he called 911 on Monday, the news station reported.  According to the family, Bailey had multiple run-ins with police in the past, and had previously told police that he was suicidal and sought “death by cop”.  An online obituary for Bailey described him as a person who “found peace in spending time fishing” and who was an “avid Pokemon trainer”. He was also a Tim Burton fan and particularly loved A Nightmare Before Christmas.",2021.0,Lombard,0,"['haven', 'was', 'shot', 'dead', 'by', 'police', 'in', 'what', 'appears', 'to', 'have', 'been',

Name Unknown,28.0,2021-06-20,Sagain,Myanmar,21.894199,96.0317,violence,not reported,"The victim was one of several unidentified trans people included on the TDoR 2021 memorial list released by Transgender Europe in November 2021.The circumstances of their deaths are not known, but at least 12 LGBTQ people are known to have been killed by regime forces between 1st February and 20th June 2021. At least 12 LGBTIQ community members have been killed by regime forces and another 73 arrested or charged since the junta’s coup for fighting against dictatorship and striving for equality, according to a report from the National Unity Government (NUG). On Wednesday, the NUG’s Ministry of Human Rights and Ministry of Women, Youths and Children’s Affairs released the situation report of the LGBTIQs after the military coup in Myanmar, in celebration of Pride Month which recognizes the valuable contributions made by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) people. LGBTIQ groups in Myanmar have actively participated in anti-regime protests since the start of the pro-democracy movement in February. The most visible sign of their participation are the rainbow flags that have been waved among the crowds at anti-coup demonstrations nationwide. As crackdowns, violence and torture against pro-democracy activists and civilians has intensified in the past few months, many LGBTIQ people across Myanmar have faced severe human rights violations, with some killed, tortured or detained by the military regime. Between Feb. 1 and June 20, at least 12 LGBTIQ people from Myitkyina, Myingyan, Monywa, Mawlamyine, Yangon, Kyaukpadaung, and Mandalay were shot dead by junta forces while participating in peaceful protests and defending protesters from military violence, the report stated.",2021.0,Sagaing,1,"['the', 'victim', 'was', 'one', 'of', 'several', 'unidentified', 'trans', 'people', 'included', 'on', 'the', 'tdor', '2021', 'memorial', 'list', 'released', 'by', 'transgender', 'europe', 'in', 'november', '2021', 'the', 'circumstances', 'of', 'their', 'deaths', 'are', 'not', 'known', 'but', 'at', 'least', '12', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'are', 'known', 'to', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'by', 'regime', 'forces', 'between', '1st', 'february', 'and', '20th', 'june', '2021', 'at', 'least', '12', 'lgbtiq', 'community', 'members', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'by', 'regime', 'forces', 'and', 'another', '73', 'arrested', 'or', 'charged', 'since', 'the', 'junta', 's', 'coup', 'for', 'fighting', 'against', 'dictatorship', 'and', 'striving', 'for', 'equality', 'according', 'to', 'a', 'report', 'from', 'the', 'national', 'unity', 'government', 'nug', 'on', 'wednesday', 'the', 'nug', 's', 'ministry', 'of', 'human', 'rights', 'and', 'ministry', 'of', 'women', 'youths', 'and', 'children', 's', 'affairs', 'released', 'the', 'situation', 'report', 'of', 'the', 'lgbtiqs', 'after', 'the', 'military', 'coup', 'in', 'myanmar', 'in', 'celebration', 'of', 'pride', 'month', 'which', 'recognizes', 'the', 'valuable', 'contributions', 'made', 'by', 'lesbian', 'gay', 'bisexual', 'transgender', 'intersex', 'and', 'queer', 'lgbtiq', 'people', 'lgbtiq', 'groups', 'in', 'myanmar', 'have', 'actively', 'participated', 'in', 'anti', 'regime', 'protests', 'since', 'the', 'start', 'of', 'the', 'pro', 'democracy', 'movement', 'in', 'february', 'the', 'most', 'visible', 'sign', 'of', 'their', 'participation', 'are', 'the', 'rainbow', 'flags', 'that', 'have', 'been', 'waved', 'among', 'the', 'crowds', 'at', 'anti', 'coup', 'demonstrations', 'nationwide', 'as', 'crackdowns', 'violence', 'and', 'torture', 'against', 'pro', 'democracy', 'activists', 'and', 'civilians', 'has', 'intensified', 'in', 'the', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'many', 'lgbtiq', 'people', 'across', 'myanmar', 'have', 'faced', 'severe', 'human', 'rights', 'violations', 'with', 'some', 'killed', 'tortured', 'or', 'detained', 'by', 'the', 'military', 'regime', 'between', 'feb', '1', 'and', 'june', '20', 'at', 'least', '12', 'lgbtiq', 'people', 'from', 'myitkyina', 'myingyan', 'monywa', 'mawlamyine', 'yangon', 'kyaukpadaung', 'and', 'mandalay', 'were', 'shot', 'dead', 'by', 'junta', 'forces', 'while', 'participating', 'in', 'peaceful', 'protests', 'and', 'defending', 'protesters', 'from', 'military', 'violence', 'the', 'report', 'stated']",the victim wa one of several unidentified trans people included on the tdor 2021 memorial list released by transgender europe in november 2021 the circumstance of their death are not known but at least 12 lgbtq people are known to have been killed by regime force between 1st february and 20th june 2021 at least 12 lgbtiq community member have been killed by regime force and another 73 arrested or charged since the junta s coup for fighting against dictatorship and striving for equality according to a report from the national unity government nug on wednesday the nug s ministry of human right and ministry of woman youth and child s affair released the situation report of the lgbtiqs after the military coup in myanmar in celebration of pride month which recognizes the valuable contribution made by lesbian gay bisexual transgender intersex and queer lgbtiq people lgbtiq group in myanmar have actively participated in anti regime protest since the start of the pro democracy movement in february the most visible sign of their participation are the rainbow flag that have been waved among the crowd at anti coup demonstration nationwide a crackdown violence and torture against pro democracy activist and civilian ha intensified in the past few month many lgbtiq people across myanmar have faced severe human right violation with some killed tortured or detained by the military regime between feb 1 and june 20 at least 12 lgbtiq people from myitkyina myingyan monywa mawlamyine yangon kyaukpadaung and mandalay were shot dead by junta force while participating in peaceful protest and defending protester from military violence the report stated
