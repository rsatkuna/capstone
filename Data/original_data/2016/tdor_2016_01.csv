> Relatives of the victim say that she was going home when police officers asked Camila an “inspection”, which she resisted.
> 
> “Her friends told me that the officers grabbed her and amid the struggle a shot rang out.” stated Martha Cecilia Montoya, Camila’s mother. “My daughter used pepper spray to defend herself, and immediately one of the cops shot her again,” she said.
> 
> Reports indicate that the young trans woman was opposed to the police inspection “only because agents wanted to touch her”. (In South and Central America, these police acts are mostly a form of abuse directly linked to the trans population, where police elements provocatively touch sensitive body zones, this was the kind of “touch” she was denying.)

The Solano Serenity Center was among the first to list Sierra on its website among trans homicide victims who must be remembered this year.
> 
> “Piecing together her life like a crossword puzzle we are learning a little about her,’” says Busey in her Planet Transgender report. ""There’s a Tumblr post where the author postulates a police conspiracy to cover up her murder which local media conspicuously called ‘suspicious.'""
> 
> The Tumblr post to which Busey refers alleges mishandling of the investigation by local police. While the author of the post remains unnamed, the individual’s allegations were repeated at the same time as the Tumblr post went live by two other trans people on Facebook (in comments now marked private) by individuals who claim to be friends of Sierra. (The author of the Tumblr post has not responded to a query by press time.)
> 
> The accusations on Tumblr and Facebook have yet to be verified because, for over a month, advocates say that Bakersfield police have not responded to queries. Advocates also note that the police’s apparent refusal to clarify the circumstances of the alleged homicide have exacerbated the transgender community’s frustration and fomented rampant speculation.

She died in hospital.

In November 2017 Rowell was convicted of her murder and sentenced in 20 years in prison.

> Rowell confessed to shooting Loera at the start of the trial, but his lawyers argued it was an act of self-defense. He allegedly believed Loera robbed him after he responded to her ad on backpage.com and visited her at her North Austin home in the early hours of Jan. 22, 2016. He told the jury that she threatened him with a bat when he came back with a loaded gun in search of his wallet, which was later found in his jacket pocket. Instead of leaving, he shot her from a foot away and fled. As Payan told the jury during closing arguments, “When you point a loaded gun at someone and shoot it at close range that’s an intentional act.”
> 
> Later that day he drove back to Childress, Texas, where his then-wife and 10-day-old son were living while he was working in Georgetown. Over the weekend he Googled numerous things, aside from how to get away with murder, including legal defense, porn, and backpage – once again looking for trans sex workers. “If he was so scared that he needed to use deadly force,” Payan asked rhetorically. “Why is he back at it the next day?”
