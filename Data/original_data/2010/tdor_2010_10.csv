The police said that there were no indications that the death was a hate crime but investigated it as a homicide.

> While there was a person of interest in this case, the ongoing investigation has yet to lead to enough solid evidence to get an arrest.
> 
> Philadelphia Police Department Homicide Capt. James Clarke said in a Philadelphia Gay News interview last year that there was DNA evidence that placed the person of interest at the house, but it was not enough to warrant an arrest.
> 
> But that's of little comfort to the people who loved her, the members of the House of Blahnik and the Philadelphia LGBT community.   The recent death of Kyra Kruz Cordova has only heightened the sense of frustration and nervousness people feel in the community about the lack of resolution of the Lee murder.
> 
> Damon Humes, founder of House of Blahnik, said to PGN Blahnik’s survivors worry that the case could fall to the wayside because of the identity of the victim.

> Stacey Blahnik wasn’t just influential in the ball scene; she was the mother of the House of Blahnik, which had 115 members at the time of her death, per a Philadelphia Gay News report. Robert Burns, the then-executive director of local black LGBT health organization COLOURS, explained to the paper that Blahnik touched many lives, “not just to those in our house, but to those in the entire ballroom community and even those who are not a part of the ballroom house culture, with the extent of the relationships and the support she provided. She was a mother figure to a lot of young people, particularly for many of our transwomen of color here in Philadelphia.”

Sonia Burgess,63,,2010_10_25_Sonia-Burgess.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1629578218057&set=a.2361225428780&type=3&theater,25-Oct-2010,,"Kings Cross, London",London,United Kingdom,51.5304767,-0.1240732,violence,run over,"Sonia died after being pushed in front of a train during the evening rush hour at at Kings Cross Underground station in London.

Senthooran Kanagasingham, 35, was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to schizophrenia, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of seven years. At the time of the attack, Kanagasingham had been undergoing gender reassignment surgery and was known as Nina. But during the trial he said he wished to be referred to as a man and by his male name.

> Kanagasingham's victim was 63-year-old Sonia Burgess, who lived as a woman with family and friends but was known in professional life as David Burgess, one of the UK's most celebrated immigration lawyers, responsible for landmark judgments in the House of Lords and the European court of human rights.
> 
> The court heard Burgess had befriended Kanagasingham and offered her support and financial help, despite worries about her mental state. Kanagasingham wanted to undergo a gender realignment, which her family in Sri Lanka opposed. The pair were returning from seeing Kanagasingham's GP in Cricklewood, north London, when she pushed Burgess under a Piccadilly line train. A note in Kanagasingham's rucksack said she was ""broke, depressed and suffering from gender dysphoria"".
> 
> In his life as David Burgess, Altman told the court, the solicitor had established ""an enviable and brilliant reputation"" in human rights and immigration law, firstly with his own law firm and then with another firm in Wood Green, north London.
> 
> But away from work Burgess lived almost entirely as a woman and was known to family and friends as Sonia. Sonia was ""gender-variant"", Altman said, and did not wish to have surgery. ""Sonia was caring and generous with her time. She was tolerant of others and she habitually helped others with their problems.""

On 8th April 2013, Kanagasingham was found dead in his cell with a plastic bag around his head, and hands tied to the bed. At the inquest, nearby prisoners reported hearing cries for help.

Sonia's death was not recorded on the official TDOR list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU).
