Tal Piterbraut-Merx,29.0,2021-10-25,Ile-de-France,France,48.8588336,2.2769952,suicide,suicide,"Tal died by suicide. He was an activist, university student and author who was dedicated to progressive causes.

> On this day we mourn the loss of our comrade (and for some, our friend) Tal Piterbraut-Merx who passed away on Monday, October 25, 2021.
>
> A dedicated militant, a brilliant university student, prolific author and comrade, Tal identified himself as a gouine and was on all fronts or almost: anti-capitalist fights, fights against adult domination, feminist fights, emancipation fights queer, of course the anti-racist fights.
>
> Tal joined the Revolutionary Jews and Jews collective on shared findings: the violence of anti-Semitism and the absence of organization on the left to oppose it. The one of the deficiencies existing in our social camp in terms of analysis and fighting anti-Semitism. The one of the need to articulate fighting anti-Semitism and fight against all forms of oppression and exploitation. On the need also to positively reinvest justice, through the struggle, but also the rediscovering of Jewish cultural and historical heritage.
>
> Tal brought into the collective his energy, his involvement, his humanity. He participated in building public interventions of the collective. This is how he was found at the stand of the gathering in memory of Ilan Halimi in 2021. Tal was also very involved in the creation and animation of anti-Semitism trainings. As in his fights against child abuse, developing a pedagogy to train anti-racist fights was a fundamental form of action for him. He shared his knowledge, his political views, his ideas.
> 
> Many of us recognized ourselves in his, in her journey and in what she was relentlessly fighting against: violence against children, violence of patriarchy, anti-Semitism, racism, capitalism, which translates to everyday da Our lives and in the flesh. His suicide, like the too many before him, reminds us bitterly that this mortal social order must be shot down without a change. Because this is especially the incest of which our comrade died.
> 
> His thought, his action and his revolutionary commitment, but also his bright and malicious personality will remain in our memories for a long time. He was undoubtedly an example of what our political camp can give the best.
>
> Our organization and the entire Diaspora can be very proud to have a person like Tal in their ranks. We will honor him by continuing his fight to victory.
>
> Tal Piterbraut-Merx, may your memory be a source of revolution.

> ""A kind person, quiet and pretty"". That's how a neighbor remembers [deadname], a Brazilian [trans woman] known as Kimberly, stabbed to death with her friend Mariela Josefina Santos Cruz, 27. [Kimberly] and Mariela were killed by Mirco Alessi, a 42-year-old separated worker and father, who confessed to their murder: for some time the Kimberly and Alessi had a stable relationship but, according to the murderer, she made constant requests for money to him, threatening to make their relationship public.
>
> At this point Alessi decided to kill her: an admission that could turn the crime into premeditated murder. According to the killer's story, he arrived at [Kimbely's] house and immediately a furious argument broke out at the height of which Alessi grabbed a large kitchen knife and repeatedly stabbed her. At home there were also two of  [Kimberly's] Dominican friends, who shared the apartment with her: Alessi also attacked them. Mariela died, collapsing in the entrance hall of the building while trying to escape. The second girl, 25, though wounded, managed to escape by jumping out of the window.

Alessi was sentenced to 30 years for their murders.

Cielo de Lucca,21.0,2021-05-10,Buenos Aires,Argentina,-34.976762,-57.9999457,violence,shot,"Cielo was killed along with her cisgender neighbour Florencia Sandoval by Florencia's police officer boyfriend following an argument. He subsequently shot himself.

> In a case that occurred this afternoon in the town of Los Hornos in La Plata, a 23-year-old Buenos Aires Police officer murdered his partner, a young woman of the same age, in a femicide, along with a 22 [other sources say 20]-year-old trans woman and then shot himself in the head, leaving himself in critical condition. He died a few hours later.
> 
> The violent sequence began around 2:30 p.m. in 164 between 62 and 63 when a call to 911 indicated that detonations of firearms had been heard. Troops from the La Plata Patrol Command and Third Police Station went to the scene and immediately noticed the presence of the body of a young woman lying on the street and that of a trans woman in a corridor. An ambulance arrived at the scene and the doctors found that both people no longer showed vital signs.
>
> Neighbors gave clues about the attacker, who had fled the scene in a white Volkswagen Gol car. In an operation, the police located the suspect and there was a chase up to 166 between 59 and 60. In that direction the alleged aggressor got out of the car, showed a firearm to the police and went into a residence. Minutes later a detonation was heard and upon entering the uniformed men they found the young man with a shot to the head, after which he was rushed to the San Martín Hospital.
> 
> Initial investigations confirmed that the shooting was a femicide and that the young trans woman was shot when she went to see what happened. The policeman was identified as Juan Ignacio Soto, who served in the UTOI, Florencia Sandoval (23) and Cielo de Lucca (22).


Soto was reportedly violent and [Cielo had defended Florencia from him before](https://www.eldia.com/nota/2021-5-12-2-55-42--cielo-la-defendio-mas-de-una-vez-de-ese-violento--policiales).

> The day of her violent death was not the first time that Cielo defended her neighbor. The two had made very good friends during the four months in which they shared land, by dividing, in 164 between 62 and 63.
> 
> The young trans woman moved to one of the three apartments that are rented on the property with her sister, but she left shortly after and the costs of the rent were left for a single person. José María (58), owner of the place, said that the deceased's idea was to leave. That's where she was when she was killed.
> 
> Agostina asserted that “that violent son of a bitch (by Juan Ignacio Soto) attacked her more than once and Cielo defended her. She told me that he would not leave them alone and from then on the chabón took hold of him and was suspicious”. To such an extent that the last time the sex workers saw each other ""was on the street, a month ago, and it was there that she told me what was happening and showed that she was all hurt,"" he remarked.
> 
> “She died doing what she loved, defending and helping those in need. I can assure you that she was a person without evil, honest and very sociable.”

Although wounded, she was able to walk down Avenida Jerusalem before falling on the corner of Rua Thebes with Jericho.

A security camera near the site captured footage of the attack. Shortly afterwards Tarley Antônio Nascimento was arrested and confessed to the crime. Authorities claim he stated that he murdered Jéssica because she was transgender.

> Sargeant Teodoro testifies that “The images are clear and he confessed as soon as we arrived at the scene. He also confessed in front of his fathers and stated the motive as trivial, futile: she was transgender, they had previous disagreements and he decided to settle the score.

As Orgulho Transgênero said in a Facebook post (which is reproduced in full below) ""*She didn't just die of covid, she died from having to live trapped in an extremely hostile environment, cruel to extremely damaging transphobia, with no support to have a professional career without support of any nature without support becoming independent of the business of that transphobic family.*""

> TRANSPHOBIA KILLS!

> Bru Waldorf was from an evangelical and transphobic middle class family, who didn't respect the fact that she was a trans woman, they never supported her and even at the time of her death the parent doesn't respect her, with revolting Facebook post as if she didn't it was the female type.
> 
> She had already posted how oppressed she was by a family that never supported who she was, a total cowardice with her dignity. She couldn't even try to change her name and gender on her birth certificate and documents because her parents wouldn't accept it.
> 
> She already posted showing desperation for finding a job that respected her social name, because it was a very oppressive family. They've already thrown it in her face that she was sustained but if they had supported the fact that they had a trans daughter and supported her in a professional career she could have a job and be independent.

They killed her. Lately she couldn't even go out once a month like before because of the pandemic and living in an environment like this, had a very big psychological impact on her. But the transphobic business let the pandemic indoors.
> 
> The genocidal Jair who is also a disgusting transphobic and scoundrel should also be held responsible for not buying the vaccines as soon as he could.
> 
> The fundamentalist religion so called Christian, the religion of parents is also to blame for this because it has always fostered transphobia, criminal LGBTphobia and are one of those responsible for putting criminal genocidal in the presidency.
> 
> Transphobia kills, transphobia burns people alive, leads people to depression, suicide, excludes from society, kicked out of the house. And when you don't kick out like Bru's case, you keep trans people being tortured in a terrible environment like what she lived through.
> 
> I have no empathy with transphobic killers. These murderers transphobic scoundrels of her parents would die, but that she was alive and well. But most times bad vase doesn't break.
> 
> Unlike these transphobic scoundrels, Bru, or Bruna, as she wanted, for me and for many friends and friends will be remembered as she really is, an amazing, amazing woman. I've cried a lot and the crying will be until when I die. You will forever be loved my dear friend.

Edu,18.0,2019-10-30,Valencia,Spain,39.625829,-0.59611,suicide,suicide,"Edu took her own life, apparently after suffering harassment and bullying over an extended period.

> The Civil Guard and the Court of Instruction No. 3 of Llíria are investigating whether harassment and teasing have been the trigger for a young transsexual from Llíria to take her own life last Wednesday afternoon. The agents of the Judicial Police team of the capital of the Camp de Túria have already begun the procedures to cite friends, fellow students and relatives as witnesses, to investigate to what extent [transphobia] in her immediate surroundings could have been a trigger in her decision to take her own life.
>
> The young woman, who had been in treatment for some time and had already taken the first steps to face the change of sex after turning 18, took her own life on Tuesday, after being alone at the home of a friend in Llíria with whom she was spending the afternoon.
>
> Hours after her death, many people expressed their solidarity with the girl and her family in social networks - mainly WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram - and criticized the mockery that the young woman had been subjected to.
>
> In fact, Levante-EMV has been able to verify the succession of insults, teasing and criticism that the young woman had been enduring for months every time she posted videos and photographs on one of her social network accounts doing what she liked most: playing songs of her favorite artists. The young woman was a great follower of the talent show La Voz.
>
> Once these suspicions of harassment have been confirmed, the judge and the Civil Guard will seek testimonies, especially from close friends, to be able to confirm if that pressure acted as a trigger to convince her to end her life, something she did while her friend was absent for a few minutes.
>
> It will also be investigated if it is true that she suffered aggressions from relatives in her home environment, and if so whether they were prompted by her decision to [live as herself].
>
> The Civil Guard will also track comments on the social networks of the young woman, mainly on Facebook and Instagram, in which she received insults and mockery regarding her transsexuality. Some of those comments date back more than a year, which shows that he had been suffering from this situation for a long time.

If the agents manage to prove the relationship between harassment and death, the case could end up being instructed as a hate crime.

Cris Blehar,65.0,2021-05-21,Kentucky,United States of America,37.83903972,-86.06595063,violence,stabbed and shot,"Cris was killed in her home. A suspect has been charged and is due to be tried in June 2022.

> The family of a U.S. Air Force veteran who was murdered in May has identified her as transgender, making her the at least 49th transgender person to be killed violently in the United States this year, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) 
> 
> 65-year-old Cris Blehar was found stabbed and shot to death in her Kentucky home. An 18-year-old suspect, Tyler J. Petty, who police say may have worked for Blehar, has reportedly confessed to the murder and will go to trial in June 2022.
> 
> Blehar’s obituary describes her as an animal lover who formerly worked for Continental Airlines and then as an Uber Driver. She left behind a son, [name redacted].
> 
> Blehar’s cousin, Mark Stephens, contacted HRC to identify her as trans. Stephens wanted Blehar to be “remembered, honored, and counted.”


Cris was a former law enforcement officer in the U.S. Air Force and retired from United/Continental Airlines. She also worked as an Uber driver and loved animals and bowling.

> “If there is one thing to know about Cris, it was that she fought fiercely to define her life as SHE wanted. Whether it was her military service, her 20+ year career in the airline industry, or her post retirement decision to buy a farm & start a family of her own. She lived life to the fullest and wanted everyone around her to live their best life as well. Growing up ‘different’ in Kentucky is certainly no easy task, something we shared in addition to being cousins, and she tackled it with the passion and zeal that only she could have. Her friends will always remember her infectious personality & her unmistakable laugh. She loved others passionately and fiercely, none more than her own son, [name redacted].”
> 
> Blehar’s son [name redacted] also remembered her, writing:
> 
> “Cris was an amazing mother and a wonderful person. She had so much love and brought a smile to many. She had a hilarious sense of humor that will live on through those that knew her. She will be sorely missed!”
> 
> Cris was full of life and it is appalling that she was so violently taken from this Earth. It is comforting to know that she was well loved by friends and family, but her death highlights the need to combat gun violence and all of the factors that contribute to these killings.”
 
As Cris' murder only came to light after the Transgender Day of Remembrance 2021 her name was not included in the official TDoR 2021 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU) in November 2021.

Normally, it is authorized from the age of 16 but for Ekai it is late “, denounce from the association, who demand that the start of the transit of these kids to their new identity is not conditioned by medical criteria. Nor did the training that the heads of the Basque Government had promised to give teachers and students of the institute where Ekai studied to avoid misunderstanding and humiliation. “They committed themselves in February of last year and they had not done anything yet.”

Morgana,41.0,2022-04-20,,Vatican City State (Holy See),41.9302935,12.4624298,uncategorised,not reported,"Morgana's body was found in the street. She was homeless and her identity was not released at the time of her death.

> Mysterious death in Northern Rome, a stone's throw from the Olympic Stadium, in Piazza Antonio Mancini. Here a 41-year-old Colombian [trans woman] was found dead in the street, still wearing all her personal belongings, wallet, cell phone and documents. This detail made it easy to identify the identity of the trans [woman] who had been reported to the authorities several times because she was irregularly present on the national territory and was homeless.
> 
> The report, as often happens, was made by a passer-by who noticed the lifeless body of the [trans woman] at the edge of the square at around 2am on Wednesday 20, triggering the Ares 118 rescue car and the intervention of the carabinieri.
> 
> All the leads are examined, but apparently it would appear neither an attack nor a robbery but at present nothing can be excluded and the autopsy on the body of the South American will be decisive. The carabinieri of the investigative unit of via in Selci and those of via Trionfale are also on site as far as they are concerned.
> 
> The first findings of the coroner did not reveal any injury but among the hypotheses under consideration there is also that of a death from overdose , which would generate a consequent investigation for death deriving from another crime.
> 
> Now the police have taken over the surveillance images of the cameras in Piazza Mancini in order to better analyze them and understand what happened.


> A Columbian trans woman was found dead on the street north of Rome, Italy 8 days ago. No name, given. One local article states that all of her belongings were with her and another on a national paper states that her purse was missing. The local article states that she was 41 and the national one that she was 51. The most likely article to be right is the local one. On the national one allegations are made about overdosing (without any proof of course, this is unfortunately common practice in Italian journalism, based on my research, the last trans woman to be dead for overdose is one killed in 2008, but if it's a non-Italian sex-worker, papers will often claim overdose when there's no proof because noone has ever challenged them in court). There were no apparent signs of struggle and an autopsy is apparently being conducted but 8 days later I still cannot find the results of it on a paper. RIP.

Name Unknown,28.0,2010-11-06,Punjab,Pakistan,31.708529,73.986401,violence,tortured and burned,"Within two days two persons, described as a “cross-dresser” and a “eunuch” have been murdered in a place usually frequented by trans people. Both bodies showed signs of brutal torture and were burned.

Leo Etherington,15.0,2017-05-31,England,United Kingdom (Great Britain),51.627422,-0.748415,suicide,suicide,"Leo died by suicide. His school had refused to use his new name even though he had transitioned the year before.

> Leo Etherington had come out at home and at school – but teachers at Wycombe high school, an all-girls grammar school, told the 15-year-old that he could not change his name on the register for another year.
> 
> Giving evidence at an inquest into his son’s death, Martin Etherington said: “The school told him he had to be 16 to change his name. He said he was angry with the school.
> 
> “I asked him if I should speak to them and he said no. I said we could wait until he was 16 and then change his name.”
> 
> The student had also been told by the family GP that he would not be eligible for gender reassignment surgery on the NHS. In his evidence his father said: “I told Leo I would fund any surgery when the time came.”
> 
> The family thought Leo was studying for forthcoming GCSE exams in his room on the afternoon of his death on 31 May. But his father found his body in his room after he missed calls to come down to dinner.

> Mr Etherington added: “The school told him he had to be 16 to change his name. He said 

The tragedy is that both the school and his GP were incorrect - there was no reason the school could not have respected his identity, and the NHS can fund testosterone therapy for trans men from age 16 onwards, and surgery from 18.

Leo's death was not included on the official TGEU TDoR 2017 list.

Lorena María del Luján Riquel,39.0,2020-08-22,Santa Fe,Argentina,-32.9624275,-60.6998469,violence,beaten,"Lorena was beaten over the head with cement blocks. Police are investigating whether the perpetrator of the crime sexually abused her before killing her. 

> Her name was Lorena María del Luján Riquel, she was 39 years old, she was a breadwinner: she had three children. She made a living as she could, it was a struggle. Those who knew her said she had a stand at a fair located in the property known as “la quinta Luciani” in the western area, sold stockings on the street and was a sex worker.
> 
> From the beginning she was part of the Bella Vista Classist and Combative Current (CCC) and marched with this group in every  event of the social organization. She was a fighter.
> 
> At dawn this Saturday she was savagely murdered at Rueda 5500. The attacker attacked her, took off some of her clothes and hit her on the head until she was killed. Then he walked off in the victim's slippers.
> 
> The femicide of Lorena Riquel was reminiscent of that of Caren Peralta, murdered in a downtown apartment with a blow to the head last February. They were both sex workers. Gabriela, from the Ammar union, said that they are struck by the fact that it is the second femicide by the same method: killed by blows to the head.
> 
> The union of sex workers is accompanying the family and in contact with the Prosecutor's Office. Some of its members decided to go to the scene to find out what happened and the details of the case are really macabre. “They expose the contempt for the life of a woman, who is harassed and fiercely attacked by a man. A clear sample of the worst face of patriarchy”, they described.

A suspect was arrested on 25th August.

> A 32-year-old man was arrested at dawn this Tuesday (25) for being suspected of being the alleged perpetrator of the brutal femicide of Lorena María del Luján Riquel, which occurred last Saturday in Rueda at 5500. He was apprehended in an operation carried out by the Brigade of Homicides of the Criminal Investigation Agency (AIC) in Rio de Janeiro at 2800.
> 
> The detainee, identified as Carlos Daniel B., was found by the security force in front of his home in Rio de Janeiro at 2800. He has a peculiarity: he has a tear tattooed on his left cheekbone. He was transferred to the headquarters of the Criminal Investigation Agency, where he was held incommunicado by order of the criminal homicide prosecutor Georgina Pairola.

Veronica Baxter,34.0,2009-03-16,New South Wales,Australia,-33.8308128,151.0532673,custodial,died in custody,"After being arrested for drug offences Veronica was incarcerated in a male prison in Sydney despite having transitioned 15 years earlier. On 16th March, she was found hanging in her cell.

> Veronica, an aboriginal from Cunnamulla county, in the south-west of Queensland, had been living as a woman since 1994 when she was 19.
> 
> In March 2009, three days after the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, she was arrested in a police sting in Redfern, Sydney, and charged with supplying a prohibited drug, and held at the NSW Silverwater Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre, a maximum security jail for men. She was not offered the opportunity of solitary confinement in a women's jail instead, that by law should be offered to non-op trans women. She was in the general male population of the prison. She had not been checked for 14 hours – a contravention of policy – when she was found hanging in her cell from a 1.5m (5 foot) bunk despite being 1.98m (6'5'') tall.

> Veronica Baxter, a MTF transgender inmate who was housed in a male prison in Sydney, hanged herself in her cell back in March 2009. But lest you think the Department of Corrective Services is somehow at fault for having a female prisoner in a male facility, the coroner has decided to clear prison officials of any wrongdoing.
> 
> Deputy State Coroner Paul MacMahon said there was nothing to suggest any failure by the department contributed to the death of Veronica Baxter, who was found dead in her cell while on remand at Sydney’s Silverwater Correctional Centre in March 2009. Ms Baxter, formerly known as [deadname], underwent three separate assessments after her arrest on serious drug offences. On each occasion, she was asked about suicidal tendencies but she denied having any such thoughts. One counsellor described her as “smiling, happy and talking”, the coroner said on Monday at the NSW Coroner’s Court at Glebe.
> 
> She was held in the cells at the Sydney Police Centre in Surry Hills for five days before being transferred to the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, a male facility at Silverwater. Two days later, the 34-year-old pre-operative transgender male-to-female prisoner used a bed sheet to hang herself from a top bunk bed in her cell while awaiting classification.
> 
> During a previous incarceration, Baxter actually put in a request to be transferred to a female facility in 2001 before withdrawing it.
> 
> But the coroner’s conclusion isn’t likely to sit well with Baxter’s loved ones. From a report last year:
> 
> On March 10, 2009, three days after Mardi Gras, Veronica Baxter was arrested by Redfern police and held on remand at the all-male NSW Silverwater Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre. Six days later, after a 14-hour break between checking her cell, she was found dead, hanging in her single cell. Veronica Baxter was an Aboriginal woman from the Cunnamulla country, south-west of Queensland. She dressed, appeared, and had identified as a woman for 15 years and was known by family and friends as a woman. Yet she was placed in an all-male jail. Was Veronica Baxter killed in custody by transphobic guards or inmates? No-one knows, the only way we will find out is if there is a full, open inquiry.
> 
> And no wonder: Baxter, despite what prison officials claim, was not the happy-go-lucky inmate officials are making her out to be:
> 
> Ten inmates who were interviewed by a police investigator about Baxter’s mental state indicated that she “appeared to be angry about something [but] there were no indications that suggested that she intended to kill herself”. Baxter had made a number of calls to prison staff using the emergency ‘knock-up box’ in her cell while locked into her cell but no one at the prison could remember who had answered them or what she had wanted.
> 
> But don’t worry: Now that she’s dead, prison officials are totally gonna fix their mistakes.

Veronica's death was not recorded on the official TDoR list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU).

Daniel Silvestrilli, 30, has been charged with her murder.

> Buenos Aires, Argentina. The travesti and trans community of La Plata is shocked by the transvesticide of Nicol Ruiz, a 35-year-old woman and mother of two children, who was savagely beaten on the head by her sister's partner. 
> 
> The attack that led to her death was perpetrated on the night of Friday, September 23, at her sister's house. When Nicol arrived at the house, located between calles 141 and 79 in the Los Hornos neighborhood of La Plata, she found her sister arguing strongly with her partner, Daniel Silvestrilli.
> 
> Nicol intervened to stop the man's violence, but the aggressor reacted against her,  hitting her hard with a broomstick on the head until Nicol collapsed unconscious. Although she was immediately transferred to the San Martín hospital, she was hospitalized in serious condition and died on Monday the 26th.
> 
> Daniel Silvestrilli was detained in Prison Unit Number 36 of the Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service. According to the information provided by the Prosecutor's Office No. 2 of La Plata to Present, that Friday the man was not complying with his temporary exit regime and an arrest warrant was released for him. Silvestrilli was already serving a sentence of 9 years and six months in prison for aggravated robbery. For the woman's death, the accused must face charges of ""homicide in the context of gender violence.""

 
Nicol was a parent who leaves behind two teenagers, and often cared for others in her community.

> Nicol was 35 years old and the mother of two teenagers. Her family emphasizes that she was the one who ran the house and was in charge of finances. During the pandemic, when the housing situation was extreme for the LGBT population , Nicol was supportive and took care of housing and asking for help for her colleagues who had nowhere to live.
> 
> The Otrans Civil Association, with whom she collaborated, remembered Nicol and demanded justice for his crime. “We express to her family and friends our deepest condolences and deep pain for the [murder] of our partner Nicol Ruiz. Likewise, we demand justice, taking into account the aggravating circumstance of hatred of self-perceived gender identity,"" the statement said. 
> 
> “Nicol was a breadwinner, the mother of two children, who after her death are left without his protection. It becomes essential, to be part of the emotional agenda of our country and for society to mourn and be horrified when they kill a fellow [trans person]”. 
> 
> Nicol Ruiz suffered from kidney failure and had to undergo dialysis treatment. For this reason, they estimate, the blow caused the immediate formation of a clot in her head that complicated the situation. Nicol's family and her friends called for a demonstration to be held on Wednesday, September 28 at 11 am in front of Prosecutor's Office 7 (at calles 56 and 57, La Plata) with the slogan ""enough violence for travestis and trans"".

Patsy was a stylist and an activist with [Pro Trans Chihuahua](https://www.facebook.com/Protransoficial/).

> Kendra Mitchell Vázquez, president of Pro Trans Chihuahua and a close friend of Patsy since her tender teenage days, remembers her cheerful and enterprising. Patsy loved life, used to face the daily pace of days with optimism and hard work, despite the precarious situations in which she could find himself. However, she ended up being a victim of violence and a world that pushes trans women to the narrowest corner of the room.
>
> Patsy had many gifts, such as being a stylist. Her job was her life, to which she printed all the passion that burned in her chest. Always innovating and studying to be the best, to leave a mark and legacy of what I could do, of what it was.
>
> As a warrior, she was a special guest at the Pro Trans Chihuahua association, where she gave a huge piece of her heart trying to watch over and protect her companions, her family.
>
> Her home, like her body, was part of the most valuable thing she had. Never satisfied, she kept building her house, block by block, detail by detail. She was always seen with construction material and in her conversations the great plans that she had for her home surfaced, of which she was increasingly proud. She was very responsible, methodical, inclined to look after her personal image, a lover of good things, beauty products, a joker, vivacious, happy, but a victim of an intolerant and violent society, especially of a Government that does not protect trans women, being murdered on Thursday, March 5, in that palace that she raised especially for a queen like her.
>
> Tears and pain now invade our community, dismayed by a situation that could have been avoided if the correct protection protocols existed for them. But, on the contrary, they live in a reality where they are nothing more than a vulnerable and fragile group, prey to hate crimes not only for those who raise their fists against them, but also of indolent society and a mocking and inhuman press.
>
> Between the crying, Mitchell, on behalf of all, demands justice and promises that it is a crime that will not go unpunished, because the voice will rise and they will go against the cruel leaders and the minds that think them.
>
> No more impunity, no more deaths of trans women, no more fear or vulnerability; We need justice, protection and respect.
>

A friend who shared her thoughts about Elif, said she was constantly hurt by her family:

> “A lot of people are responsible for this suicide. Many of my trans friends committed suicide, but Elif was very special to me.”

Elif worked as a cleaner in a factory during the early months of 2016. At the time she told Pembe Hayat that she still missed her family and was ill treated by the factory manager and employees during her time at work.

> “When I started my transition, they knew my situation because I was in the same workplace. There is a lot of sexism in the factories. Women and men are not given the same jobs. But they treat me like they do to their business. They do not approve that their ablutions will be ruined, but they always have a job done by the guys in the factory and they call me a man and make me do it.” . They are trying to screw me up.
> The women working in the factory are doing the same thing. They know my situation. This is breaking my morale. Working conditions at work are already very heavy. There is a special discrimination against me as this is not enough.”

Elif's death was not recorded on the official TDoR 2018 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU) in November 2018.

Helen Brigette Maldonado Maldonado,28.0,2021-11-12,Guayas,Ecuador,-2.0523001,-79.9459419,custodial,murdered,"Helen was one of 68 inmates killed during a riot in Penitenciaría del Litoral de Ecuador on the night of Friday 12th November.

The country's prison system has been under a state of emergency since 29th September after the worst prison massacre recorded in the country, which took place in the same prison. [A list of those killed in the riot given to their families](https://www.facebook.com/josemiguel.alzamorabaidal/posts/1326072414484588) shows Helen as the 34th victim.

> She was 20 years old when she decided to give in to her transformation. Her preference for the feminine and her delicate treatment cost her pain, rejection, loneliness ... Nothing prevented her skin from giving space to the name she chose: Helen.
> 
> Each letter was engraved on her arm along with ink-stained stars. That is now one of the few signs to identify her remains . Helen Maldonado was murdered on the violent night of November 12, 2021, in Penitenciaría del Litoral de Ecuador. She died 17 days before her 29th birthday, while serving a 30-month prison sentence after a few grams of H.
> 
> Before the massacre, she and other trans-women asked for help. [Odalys Cayambe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gexYPdZlVA) says that they knew that a new bloody attack was being prepared and they begged for their transfer from the Peni to the priority area of ​​the Regional prison a few meters away, where serving sentences is a little more bearable for the [LGBT+] population.
> 
> “Helen is just the voice of what we have asked the State for years: respect for identity, gender expression, clothing in the prison system. We are and were there - in men's prisons - because we have a penis; the rest don't matter to them ”.
> 
> Odalys directs the Trans Community Network of Ecuador Vivir Libre, which since 2017 has supported more than 200 transsexual women who were and are incarcerated for street fights, drug use or because they are accused of robbery by clients seeking sexual services. That is how she met Helen, in ward 6. She still does not know how she got to the transitional area, where she was massacred. The torture, says Odalys, begins much earlier, as soon as they set foot in the cells. “Being inside is a matter of survival, of existing and resisting. One way of resisting is prostitution, they are forced to be slaves of the system, to be mules… ”.

Helen made her living as a hairdresser and sex worker and had been in prison for more than a year, serving a 30 month sentence in a men's prison for possession of a small quantity of heroin.
 
> Diane Rodriguez , national director of the Ecuadorian Federation of LGBTI Organizations, recalls that Helen Maldonado arrived in Guayaquil and worked in a hairdresser and also worked as a sex worker. Helen was arrested for micro-trafficking of drugs and was serving a sentence of two and a half years, according to information published by the digital medium EdicionCientonce , which also indicates that in March 2022, Helen could request a change to the semi-open rehabilitation regime , which consists of to serve the rest of the sentence outside of prison with family, labor, social or community reintegration activities.
> 
> Although Helen was not an activist in the LGBTI community, ""she knew about and was linked to organizational spaces, but she did not articulate as an activist, "" says Diane. Community members who knew her, says Diane, remember that Helen was a shy person and that her arrest was a surprise, because she was not linked to any gang.
> 
> When the massacre started, Helen was able to call her mother and tell her what was happening, Diane recalls. Helen's mother and sister lived through the ordeal of families searching for the bodies of their loved ones. Both had to identify Helen's body, first among the remains of those who were dismembered, not finding her there, they were taken with the cremated bodies, where they recognized her body.
> 
> According to a report published in Indómita , one day before the massacre, “Helen Brigitte took a photo, in profile, smiling, loose hair, shorts and a red, white and blue striped diver and sent it by WhatsApp to a group of friends with two words: ""I'm fine ."" Shots had already been heard all week in the Penitentiary.
> 
> Despite the fact that Helen was a trans woman, she was being held in a men's prison. Their story is a ""voice"", Odalys Cayambe , director of the trans organization Vivir Libres, told local media. The mistreatment that Helen received as a person of gender diversity, also happens with 60 other trans women who are in the Penitentiary , according to Cayambe told Indómita .

Andresa Santos,36.0,2021-04-24,Amazonas,Brazil,-3.129831717,-60.02596743,violence,beaten,"Andresa's body was found by police officers conducting a routine patrol. She had been beaten with a piece of wood.

> Manaus / AM - A [trans woman], identified so far only as 'Joelma', was murdered at dawn this Saturday (24th), at around 1 am, on Rua 10 de Julho with Lobo D'Almada, in the Centro district, in the south of Manaus.
> 
> According to information provided by the team from the 24th Companhia Interativa Comunitária (Cicom), which answered the incident, the police officers were doing a routine patrol when they noticed a body lying on the floor at the address mentioned.
> 
> When they decided to get out of the car and get closer, they realized it was a possible homicide. The police quickly dispatched the team from the Mobile Emergency Service (Samu), who arrived at the scene and confirmed the death.
> 
> Police at the scene had information that the [trans woman] had possibly  been beaten several times before she died.
> 
> While the Department of Scientific Technical Police (DPTC) were at the scene undertaking forensic work on the body they found a piece of wood covered by bloodstains, indicating that was indeed beaten.

Subsequent reports named ""Joelma"" as Andresa Santos and gave some background about her.

> Andresa Santos was a woman full of dreams. She told her family that she wanted to go to Aesthetics College, because she liked the idea of ​​being able to change bodies. She also wanted to start the process of gender reassignment, and even went on to do some medical consultations. But her biggest dream was not to die early, as [trans women in Brazil] have a life expectancy of only 35 years because of the violence to which they are exposed. Despite all of this, Andresa was beaten to death on Saturday (24), in the center of Manaus, at the age of 36.
> 
> ""She went out that night to have fun. She said 'I'm going there', but she didn't come back. Then we found out that she had been murdered. They ended my sister's story. They destroyed her dreams,"" reports the victim's sister, Evalcilene Santos, in an exclusive interview to EM TEMPO .
>
> When she thinks of her sister, all Evalcilene can say is how dreamy the young woman was. Andresa lived in Maués (municipality 259 km from Manaus), but moved to the capital in November 2020, already running away from prejudice.
> 
> ""In the countryside, people called her male and she didn't like it. She wanted to be called Andresa and respected for that. When she came to Manaus, she started wanting to study and change her life, but it was very difficult without having a job because of the pandemic"", said Evalcilene.

Juan Antonio Martinez Matos, 26, confessed to the murder. Reportedly he killed them after discovering that they were not a cisgender woman.

> Finding accurate information to identify murder victims as trans or killed because of their gender presentation is a consistent challenge. Just this week the brutal murder of Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado was reported as that of a “gay teen” with male pronouns used when referring to Lopez Mercado. There has been very little coverage of the fact that Lopez Mercado was a sex worker with a female presentation. Murder suspect Juan antonio Martinez Matos said he thought Lopez Mercado was female but then “realized that the teenager was actually male.”
> 
> I don’t know how Lopez Mercado identified, but Martinez Matos’ statement tells us that they didn’t conform to his strict understanding of gender: Martinez Matoz thought Lopez Mercado was female and then changed his opinion, the reason given for the murder. So Lopez Mercado’s name has been added to the list of those we remember.

Keyshia Blige,33.0,2015-03-07,Illinois,United States of America,41.75527,-88.309507,violence,shot and crashed,"Keyshia was shot in the shoulder while driving a friend through Aurora's South Side in the early hours of 7th March. She crashed the car and died at the scene.

Her murder was not reported as being that of a trans woman until 5 months later in August.

> Even as people were gathering in 20 cities across the United States for the Aug. 25 Trans Liberation Tuesday event to stand up for and acknowledge the then-18 transgender women murdered in 2015, news stories began to break about an Aurora, Illinois, woman named Keyshia Blige. But the incident had not occurred earlier in the day, over the prior weekend or even during the month of August.
> 
> Blige was killed in the early hours of March 7. A statement from the Aurora Police Department reached WGN news which reported the incident that afternoon. The Aurora Beacon News—part of the Chicago Tribune Media Group—followed with a more detailed article March 24. The Aurora PD and both WGN and The Beacon News referred to Blige as a male and used her birth name. The Beacon News noted in their report that Blige had recently begun transitioning.
> 
> It was five-months later, on Aug. 23, when Elizabeth Marie Rivera—the creator of the Trans Social Butterfly Network—corrected both the Aurora PD and The Beacon News in a Facebook post.
> 
> Outrage followed as it became clear that Blige had been revictimized due to the failure of both the Aurora PD and the media to correctly report her gender and her name.

Her best friend Sasha Love told the Guardian that Blige identified as transgender and used female pronouns:

> “She was the happiest I had ever seen her once she started transitioning,” Love recalled to the Guardian. Love said that Blige first began realizing her identity once they started performing in drag in the late-2010s. They had both been attracted to it not only because they liked to dress up, but because they had learned how to lip-synch while growing up in their church choir.
> 
> “When she would dress up, she would tell me ‘I love being Keyshia. I want to be Keyshia,” Love said. The two performed at weekly shows outside the city of Chicago, where Love was the host, too.
> 
> But Blige’s attitude changed on 24 June 2011 when she was the victim of a hate crime in a neighboring city, when four men attacked her for being gay – hitting her 30 times, he told police – and leaving her with nerve damage to the face. The four men were later convicted or pleaded guilty to the hate crime. All men were ordered to pay restitution, according to the Chicago Tribune.
> 
> “For a while she stopped doing shows because of the hate crime and she gained more weight,” Love told the Guardian. “She was more concerned with her weight and how she looks, and stopped dressing up.”
> 
> Late last year, after significant weight loss and renewed confidence, she started doing shows more and began coming out as transgender, Love said.
> 
> “At first when her family found out, they were like: Oh my god, what is [she] doing?” she said, “but I think once they realized that [Keyshia] is going to do what [Keyshia] is going to do, they got better. Her family they were coming around to the point where they were coming around”.

According to the ombudsman of the São Paulo State Police, Julio Cesar Neves, the “story was badly told”. The ombudsman wants to know if there has been an irregularity committed by a police officer. “It’s appalling to see a body inside a police car inside a police station parking lot and the Civil Police does not explain it right.”

> A [trans woman] who did not have her identity revealed was found dead late Thursday morning (13) inside a vehicle of the Civil Police of Sao Paulo. The case happened in the 77th Police District, located at Glete Mall, 827, in the Santa Cecília neighborhood, west of the state capital.
>
> According to the history of the occurrence, registered at the police station and to which the report of the portal RedeTV! had access, when two police officers would take the car to leave the DP, they realized that the [trans woman] was [dead] in the area reserved for prisoners. The car had damage to the windows, bodywork, lock and internal acrylic.
>
> The section police chief, Marco Antonio Pereira, and the deputy chief Felipe Martins da Silva went to the DP, viewed the images from the police station's security cameras and reported no irregularities by police.

> **ON THE CHANGES AND IDENTITIES**
> By Kyara Barbosa
> 
> According to medicine and society I was born a boy, but I never identified myself as such. By the age of 11 I was already affectionately related to boys, I did not feel in a homo relationship. At age 14 Kyara was born, of everything that existed inside the box, being woman was the one that approached me more.
> Even though I felt fulfilled by assuming a feminine identity and living in my reality this condition, I always felt that something was missing.
> 
> Now, at the age of 23 — nine years after starting my transition — I feel like I’m still at the beginning of everything; today I do not identify myself as a woman, and very much as a man. What I feel and I know is that my identity as a human being is not limited to gender binarism, but rather the possibilities.
> It remains a trans woman that for political reasons is claimed transvestite, more fundamentally, these issues of gender is a mere social illusion. I can be free without having a gender, in fact, if I want one.
> 
> I am a human being who thinks, who breathes and feels and that is enough for me.
> 
> My voice is too thick to be feminine, and damn, I love my voice. Just like my voice, my measurements do not fit within a standard and that’s what I think is beautiful: it’s not fit into standards. I feel like an unlimited human being, that I can have as many identities as I want, as many sexualities as I can, and none of this interferes directly with what I am.
> There are things I do not understand and do not want to understand, but only taste the freedom that has already been arrested.

Yenifer León,33.0,2020-05-27,Moscow,Russian Federation,55.751634,37.618704,medical,COVID-19,"Yenifer died in hospital from viral pneumonia. She was visiting from Cuba, became trapped in Moscow during the pandemic lockdown and then ran out of money for her HIV medication.

> Yenifer, 33, had come to Moscow from Cuba ""on a shopping spree,"" as she told a newspaper on April 22. It was the second time. The previous one, a couple of years ago, brought three suitcases loaded with T-shirts, underwear and kitchenware to the island. The 120 kilos of rigor in goods that the authorities allow Cubans to take to the country. On the island, where the shortage of products increases in value, she sold the material and made a profit. She wanted to repeat the operation to which a good part of the 25,000 Cubans who enter Russia each year are dedicated, and which has become so frequent that it has illuminated an entire irregular infrastructure - housing in flats, transportation, procedures, passages - around to that business.
>
> But the pandemic came. The closing of borders. The self-isolation regime in the Russian capital. The digital pass system to move around the city. Yenifer and thousands of other Cubans were stranded in Moscow. And she ran out of money. And the antiretroviral drugs she was taking. And the roach-filled apartment she lived in was coming down on him. I was worried. Unlike many other Cubans who come to Russia to stay - some, deceived by the mafias with the promise of a job or the commitment to cross them to Europe - Yenifer wanted to return to the Caribbean island. She had insistently called the Cuban consulate without receiving any response, she said. She was afraid of the police, of discrimination for being trans, black, and having HIV.
>
> ""I can not take anymore. On Monday I will request discharge, ”said one of the last messages from the AE Rabujin tuberculosis hospital in Moscow. ""Blessings! They already did the analyzes and the plates, now to wait for results, ”said another, edged with emoticons. her favorite: the little face that sends a heart-shaped kiss.
>
> On May 5 she began to feel bad. A journey then began through the ins and outs of the Russian health system that ends with those unanswered calls to her mobile. Yenifer was admitted to Moscow's infectious hospital number 2. It was suspected that she could be infected with coronavirus, but the tests were negative. She was diagnosed with viral pneumonia but from other causes, she then explained by phone. She was there for 23 days. She did not speak Russian and could only communicate with the Google translator, says Anna Voronkova, a volunteer who collaborates independently to help the Cuban community. “Sher case exemplifies that if you don't know the language or the rules, if you don't know how to navigate the paper bureaucracy, it's as if you don't have rights. And even more so if you are a trans woman in a country like Russia, ”says Voronkova, who regrets the low collaboration of the Cuban consular authorities.in a time of need for the global health crisis. The system thus rests precariously on the shoulders of volunteers and specialized NGOs without which the most vulnerable would not have assistance.
>
> On March 22, when she thought she was going to be discharged, she was sent to the Rabujin Hospital. She had been diagnosed with tuberculosis. She remained there for five days. When Voronkova called the center less than a week later, she was told that she had died a few hours ago. That she had two-thirds of her lungs badly damaged.
>
> Her family is still waiting for more information from the Cuban consular authorities. ""We are devastated, nobody tells us anything,"" laments her mother, Carmen Cárdenas, by phone from Jovellanos, east of Havana. She was a single mother, she says, and although she has another daughter and is a great support, she was very close to Yenifer. She explains that she wants to repatriate the body and her belongings, but that she cannot explain if it is possible and how.

Diamond Kyree Sanders/Diamond Nicole,23.0,2021-03-03,Ohio,United States of America,39.1413956,-84.5313402,violence,shot,"Diamond was found in a parking lot suffering from a gunshot wound. She died in hospital.

> She was 23-years-old, born and raised in Cincinnati. On March 3, she became the latest Black trans woman murdered in the U.S.
> 
> Her name was Diamond Kyree Sanders. She also was known as Diamond Nicole.
> 
> Cincinnati police responded to a report of a person shot on Morrison Avenue around 3:42 a.m., according to a Wednesday afternoon news release. They discovered the wounded 23-year-old Kyree Sanders in a parking lot. Firefighters took Sanders to a hospital, where she died.
> 
> Police at first said it might have been a bias crime, then claimed it was ‘greed’ because her purse was stolen. I still don’t understand why the police are so quick to jump to conclusions about motive when they haven’t even caught the murderer. They don’t know the shooter was the one who stole her purse. Or that it was the motive rather than a hasty decision, perhaps to delay identifying the victim? I’m not clear on why it took so long for her death to be acknowledged by the media.
> 
> Diamond studied at The Ohio State University and had recently been working at Nordstrom.  She had thousands of friends on Facebook and her timeline was filled many cute, fashionable photos. The obituary written by her family speaks volumes to her dynamic personality and how much she was loved. Her 24th birthday would have been on April 10.

Diamond's obituary reads:

> “Diamond was a ball of energy as a child and even up to her time of death. She valued her family and enjoyed spending time with them. As a child, she would say “I love my WHOLE family!” At the last family Thanksgiving dinner, Diamond let her family know she was thankful that they accepted her for who she was as a transgender. In her younger years, Diamond spent many weekends with her Aunt Terron and Grandmother Dianne, baking cookies and making one of her favorite meals, “pigs in a blanket”. They also took Diamond and her siblings on trips to the Bahamas, Florida (Walt Disney World), Detroit and Gatlinburg to show her the world is much bigger than just Cincinnati.”
> 
> “As an adult, Diamond was a traveler, known to be in New York City one week and New Orleans the following week. Diamond was really into fashion. She always coordinated her attire from head to toe, including matching hair and nails. She was known to say, “I have to be cute, honey!” A few weeks before her death she was in her grandmother’s closet putting on her fur coat, clothes, and jewelry. Diamond’s unique style, charm, and personality will be greatly missed.”

Franchez Rivers, 33, Christopher Hisle, 28, and Kiara Davis, 29. were subsequently indicted for her murder:

> An attorney for one of three people charged in the March killing of a 23-year-old transgender woman in Clifton told a judge Thursday ""there is more to this case.""
>
> At an arraignment Thursday for Franchez Rivers, Hamilton County Municipal Judge William Mallory set bond for Rivers at $2 million. The 33-year-old Spring Grove Village resident was arrested Wednesday, court records say.
>
> Rivers was one of three people indicted Thursday by a Hamilton County grand jury in the March 3 fatal shooting of Diamond Kyree Sanders. The others charged are: Christopher Hisle, 28, and Kiara Davis, 29.
>
> Hisle has been in the Hamilton County Justice Center since April, after being arrested for illegally carrying a loaded gun in an incident unrelated to Sanders' death. Hisle had a previous felony conviction at the time. He pleaded guilty Sept. 8 to felony charges including carrying a concealed weapon. He also is charged with possessing ""a large amount of marijuana."" That case is still pending.
>
> Davis was arrested and jailed Thursday, records show.
>
> Rivers, Hisle and Davis are charged with murder, aggravated robbery and felonious assault.

Kayla Moore,41.0,2013-02-12,California,United States of America,37.869058,-122.270455,custodial,died in custody,"Kayla died in the custody of Berkely police after a mental health call.

The police said in a report released after her death that she was combative with officers who went to her home that night, and officers needed to restrain her. Once she stopped breathing, officers removed the restraints, performed CPR and took her to a hospital, but she died there a short time later.

> More than five years after a paranoid schizophrenic transgender woman died in police custody, a federal judge has tossed out the lawsuit her family filed for wrongful death.
> 
> The family of Kayla Moore alleged in the lawsuit filed in 2014 against the city of Berkeley that six officers used excessive force and suffocated Moore by holding her down on a futon during a struggle after they were called to an Allston Way apartment on Feb. 12, 2013, for a mental health check. The city however, contended that minimal and appropriate force was used and sought a dismissal of the lawsuit in federal court, which was granted last week.
> 
> In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer agreed with the city, and ruled that Moore’s father, Arthur Moore, did not provide enough evidence to show that his daughter was discriminated against related to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The judge had previously dismissed the excessive force and discrimination claims alleged by Moore’s family back in 2016.
> 
> In his ruling, the judge states he initially thought there would be issues related to the ADA claims that could be tried: that officers mistakenly arrested Kayla Moore because they took the effects of her disability as a crime, and did not reasonably accommodate her disability during the arrest, the judge wrote.
> 
> The family had alleged in their lawsuit that officers did not administer CPR because she was transgender, and that officers made discriminatory comments about her, calling her “it.”
> 
> But the judge ruled Arthur Moore did not put forward sufficient evidence to support those claims. He said that no reasonable juror could find that Arthur Moore had met his burden of proving the city failed to accommodate Kayla Moore, or that it was a discriminatory arrest.

Kayla's death was not recorded on the official TDoR 2013 list.

> LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - Cypress Ramos’ friends are demanding justice, after the 21-year-old’s body was found in a storage unit Saturday. The murder warrant for 32-year-old Allan Montemayor reveals information about the death. The warrant says Cypress died after being struck with a hard object. Police records show that Montemayor says he believed a song told him to kill Cypress but also believed that Cypress heard a song with instructions to kill Montemayor.
> 
> Cypress’ friend, Camilla Urbina, isn’t buying Montemayor’s story and wants justice. “He tried to burn my friend, literally. Like burn, burn them up,” Camilla said.
> 
> Police say security camera video captured Montemayor’s truck at the storage unit near the 2700 block of North Frankford Ave. on Saturday. He and someone else entered the storage unit, but an hour and 20 minutes later, he came out alone and drove off. Investigators tracked him down and say they found blood on his legs. “And there was blood on his pants, I believe that something else happened. And the truth will come out. And you will pay, promise,” Camilla said.
> 
> Montemayor told police he had been in the bathroom and when he came out he saw Cypress had set a fire. He then said Cypress “came at him with a bat...and it was either me or [her]”
> 
> [A friend of Cypress] doesn’t believe that’s what happened. “She is not that strong to even hit a person with a crowbar or a four-by-four or whatever it was that hit him when he was out of the restroom. There’s no way.”

Montemayor later told polcie that ""a song told him to kill her"".

Cypress was a drag performer in Lubbock and was well known and loved in the gay community.

Mano,28.0,2022-03-18,Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,Pakistan,34.0063526,71.5664651,violence,shot,"Mano was shot dead by her ex-partner after he became violent during an argument.

> PESHAWAR: A man shot dead a transgender person in Jangi Mohallah area in the limits of Khan Raziq police station here on Friday.
> 
> It was the third such incident of targeting transgender persons in the province in less than a week.
> 
> A police official told Dawn that the slain transgender person identified as Mano was friends with a local identified as Sanaullah.
> 
> He said that Sanaullah got married sometime back and Mano was not happy over [her] friend’s marriage and would quarrel with him. He said that on Friday Sanaullah allegedly shot dead Mano after an argument and fled the scene.
> 
> Police have registered an FIR against the suspect.

Subsequently it emerged that Sanaullah had shot Mano dead after she asked him to repay money he had borrowed from her. She was buried by her community after her birth family refused to accept her body.

> For many days before her death, Mano, a trans woman from Peshawar, had been fretting about her expenses. Weddings were a major source of income for her and she was worried that, with the onset of Ramazan, she wouldn’t be making any money for about a month.
>
> She had a way out, but it was a difficult one. A man she had previously been romantically involved with had borrowed a sum of over Rs800,000 from her: if she could get it back, she wouldn’t have to worry about money for the foreseeable future.
>
> She decided to give it a try.
>
Last Friday afternoon, Mano made her way to a printing press in Peshawar’s Mohallah Jangi area, next to the historic Qissa Khwani Bazaar. This press was owned by Sanaullah, her former acquaintance. She approached him and explained her predicament; why she wanted her money back. He turned her down and told her to get lost, but she made it clear she wasn’t going to leave without the money she was owed. Enraged at her persistence, Sanaullah shot her dead. He escaped through the labyrinthine streets of the area.
>
> Mano’s family, which hails from the Batkhela area of Malakand, refused to even accept her body, leaving it to the local transgender community to arrange her last rites. Arzoo Khan, president of the Transgender Association KP, told Dawn that Mano’s family refused to take part in her burial, saying they wanted nothing to do with her either in life or in death.
>
> “We had to arrange people to bathe her body. Our neighbours shouldered her coffin to the graveyard where she was laid to rest.”

> The Landless Rural Workers Movement of the state of Pernambuco deplores the murder of militant Aline da Silva, a landless [i.e. homeless] [trans woman] who lived in the Malhada camp in the municipality of Arcoverde (PE). Aline was part of the Youth Collective and was a young woman active in the activities of the Movement. One of the last activities she participated in was the Resistance Caravan for the Semi-arid Lula Livre.
>
> She was murdered at dawn on Aug. 19 with a stab wound to her neck as she was leaving a party when a man who did not know her saw her at the bus stop and decided to hurt her. As fascism has been growing as a political and ideological bloc, led by leader Jair Bolsonaro, who normalises the deaths of women and LGBT, hatred, violence and injustice have advanced. Because of this, violence against women and LGBT [people] increases daily.

January Marie Lapuz,26.0,2012-09-29,British Columbia,Canada,49.219593,-122.908372,violence,stabbed,"January was stabbed at around 10pm on Saturday 29th September. She died in hospital.

> A Vancouver support group for the transgender community is mourning the loss of one of their members after she was stabbed to death on Saturday.  
>
> Police identified the victim of New Westminster’s first homicide of the year Thursday as 26-year-old January Marie Lapuz, who legally changed her name from [deadname] in 2008.
>
> The stabbing death happened in the 500-block of 3rd Avenue at about 10 p.m. on Saturday and Lapuz died later in hospital. Police said an Asian man, around 5-5 tall, was seen running from the scene.

January was the first transgender person to hold an executive position with Sher Vancouver, a support group for South Asian gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.

> Alex Sangha, Founder of Sher Vancouver, a support group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender South Asians said the community is shocked and saddened by her death.
>
> “She was very young and really a bright light and shining star,” Sangha said. “Everyone is very sad and very shocked. The way she died was very sad.”
>
> Sangha said Lapuz, who became social coordinator of Sher Vancouver in 2009, faced a lot of challenges as a transgender woman.
>
> “She had a lot of inner turmoil as a woman who was transgender and living in poverty with limited social support as an immigrant,” Sangha said. “We’re already very at risk in the community, a lot of people stigmatize [transgender people] and I just think it’s horrible – it’s a huge loss.”
>
> Despite these challenges, Sangha said she excelled as social coordinator of the group. “She was so natural with people, such great communication skills. She was the host of all our events, did fundraising… she was a great singer, she was a good public speaker,” Sangha said.

Thabata Oliveira Blus,31.0,2020-02-10,Minas Gerais,Brazil,-19.9343962,-43.9312059,violence,stabbed,"Thabata was stabbed in the early hours of Tuesday 21st January in the Savassi neighborhood. She was treated in hospital and discharged, but died from complications two weeks later.

> Family and friends seek explanations for the death of Thabata Oliveira, 31, a [trans woman] who was stabbed on Afonso Pena, in the Center-South region of Belo Horizonte, in the early hours of January 21st. The victim was hospitalized and underwent medical care. However, she felt ill about two weeks after being discharged and died of complications from treatment.
>
> Now, the family's goal is to find out who stabbed Thabata. “We want answers, we want justice. She had a family too. We are feeling the loss very much. Thabata was a wonderful person, she never hurt anyone. Let's find out who did it,” said the [trans woman's] mother, Silvana Oliveira, 51.

Thabatha had been lucky to survive the attack on 21st January, and it is absolutely tragic that she still lost her life despite being discharged from hospital.

> Even with a knife stuck in her back, Thabata managed to ask for help at a snack bar in the region, where the employees called the PM and Samu (Mobile Emergency Service). The victim told the police that a man was responsible for the attack, but did not identify the suspect.
>
> Thabata was taken to the João XXIII Hospital, where she was admitted and was discharged on 27 January. She was instructed to stay at rest and use medication. “She was doing well and respecting medical orders. We went to the doctor on February 6 and the doctor said that her lung was already fine. In fact, she was already going out with some friends. I even warned her that she should be careful,” says Silvana.
>
> On February 8, everything looked fine. but Thabata felt bad. “On Saturday, she left the house and said she would go around the corner. Before reaching the corner, Thabata came home calling for help. “She started vomiting blood and fell to the floor having a seizure. People were desperate and called Samu. The emergency services were slow to come and, when they arrived she was already very weak. She suffered a cardiac arrest and died in the hospital.”

Dimitra Kalogiannis,64.0,2021-04-09,Attica,Greece,37.9303568,23.6838523,violence,run over,"Dimitra was killed in a hit and run incident on 9th April. Her body was not found until seven weeks later when the police were shamed into searching for her.

The driver involved in the incident was subsequently arrested.

> The driver allegedly involved in the hit-and-run accident that killed a 64-year-old transgender woman who went missing from an Athens psychiatric hospital on April 6 has been arrested, according to Greek media.
> 
> News website in.gr said the suspect was identified by a fingerprint on Monday. Based on information attained by ANT1, the driver has admitted his action and is expected to appear before a prosecutor.
> 
> Kalogiannis was admitted to Athens’ Dromokaiteio Psychiatric Hospital on April 6 after being assaulted in her native Lesvos by a group of local teenagers who had hounded her on numerous prior occasions before forcing their way into her home, bullying her viciously and recording the incident on their mobile phones, then posting the footage on social media.
> 
> On April 9, she was killed in a hit-and-run in the area of Palaio Faliro, in southern Athens, and transferred to Tzanneio hospital. A DNA test that was only recently ordered by the authorities ascertained that the body found at the scene of the accident was that of Dimitra Kalogiannis, born Dimitris.
> 
> One of Dimitra’s brothers, Panagiotis, is expected to file charges over anyone responsible for the delay in launching a search of his sister.
> 
> Gerasimos Kourouklis, director of Silver Alert, has said that the service was informed of Kalogiannis’ disappearance by her brother and Dromokaitio, on April 6. He then immediately filed a report to declare her missing but the police did not proceed with the case because it viewed Kalogiannis as a “fugitive” from a psychiatric institution. Dimitra was killed in the car accident three days later and by the time the search was officially launched, she was already buried as a victim of unknown identity.

Dimitra was extremely vulnerable and had been institutionalised as a teenager after coming out to her family.

> Dimitra Kalogiannis told her parents at the age of 14 that she was a girl. Her revelations were summarily dismissed and she was institutionalized.
> 
> Unknown to Dimitra, her family secertly began giving her psychotropic drugs which inhibited her functioning and thought processes. These drugs did her immeasurable harm since they were coupled with invasive and traumatic conversion regimens.
> 
> The Greek Reporter wrote that Kalogiannis was ping-ponged from chronic incarceration in clinics and years of being fed psychotropic medication to adjust the chemical makeup of her brain and nervous system. These medications were recommended to her family to treat her “mental illness” -declaring herself a female although she has the physical anatomy of a male. Fast forward 40 years and society has finally understood that gender identity and sexuality are not conditions to be fixed.
> 
> Dimitra took care her parents as they grew older on the small island of Lesvos just miles from the Turkish shore. It was becuse of that location and the influx of refugeess traveling through Turkey to Greece that we know of life and death. Her plight drew the attention of the international reporters who made two short films about her. This past December cinematographer Tzeli Hadjidimitriou uploaded a video of the interview she conducted with Kalogiannis in her home in Lesvos, titled “Mr. Dimitri and Mrs. Dimitroula.”

In September 2021 her case was one of six reopened following the arrest of Nicolás Gonella, ringleader of the [Comando Barneix](https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/judiciales/comando-barneix-surge-nombre-formaba.html) group, on child pornography charges:

> Justice is now investigating as a possible perpetrator the defendant in the Barneix case, who in a conversation claimed the homicides.
>
> Justice is investigating the man who was sentenced to prison for the threats in the Barneix case, for the murder of [six] trans women. These killings, which occurred between 2011 and 2012, have yet to be clarified. In the seizure of documents from the defendant's house, Nicolás Gonella mentions in a conversation with an individual from a foreign organization that he was responsible for these murders.
>
> On November 23, 2011, the body of Ángela, 49, was found in a dilapidated house at the entrance to the Cerro, on calle Haití near the Pantanoso stream. She had been shot three times.
>
> On February 17, 2012, ""La Brasilera"" was shot in Roosevelt Park. With several shots she was taken in serious condition to the Clínicas hospital, where she died fifteen days later.
>
> A few days later, another trans woman was shot to death in the same park. On March 10, Gabriela was found by a dog walker, north of Avenida Giannatassio. She was 37 years old. They killed her with two shots to the back of the neck but nothing was stolen from her.
>
> On April 12, 2012, the only crime of that period that is clarified occurred. Pamela, 26, was murdered in the city of Melo. His body appeared in a hookah in the Feder neighborhood. She died as a result of the beatings. Two adults and a teenager were prosecuted.
>
> Just ten days later, in Montevideo they assassinated Cassandra, 39 years old. She was found dead with a shot in the neck in Lima and Paraguay, in Aguada. It was ruled out that it had occurred in the course of a robbery.
>
> On September 23, 2012, ten months after the first murder, the sixth occurred: Kiara, 25, was killed by a bullet in the neck from a 22-caliber weapon in a Prado park, on Castro and Carlos Brussa. Her body was mutilated and she was also doused with fuel and set on fire.

> It is a mystery about the death of a 50-year-old [some reports say 30] transsexual woman of South American origin who was found dead at home in Frosinone. A neighbor called the police, suspicious after repeatedly knocking on the door.
>
> The agents, once inside, found the woman's body lying on the ground, lifeless. No signs of violence were found on the body. A tragic news that cannot exclude a priori the path of transphobia, as remarked by Francesco Angeli , president of Arcigay Rome.
>
> We learn in the press that a young trans girl has been found lifeless inside her apartment in Frosinone. It is important not to exclude in the investigations that it is a murder occurred due to transphobia. Italy in fact holds the sad record in Europe of murders due to transphobic hatred, and the many victims of recent years make us reflect on how much the theme of the security and isolation of trans people in our country is totally out of the interest of politics, which should represent everyone.
>
> Once again, moreover, some press reported the news narrating it in the male, as denounced on social media by Gianmarco Capogna.
>
> Still to ascertain many details of what happened, yet, the local press deemed it necessary immediately to focus on the victim's transsexual identity. An identity entirely narrated to men, ""a trans"", ""a young transsexual from Paraguay"". There are no certain details yet but if it were not an FtM (female to male) person, the entire narrative and the language used is completely wrong and disrespectful of the gender identity of the victim.
>
> Even in an article the possibility of violence against the victim is defined as "" homophobia "" and not transphobia.
>
> We can no longer accept that trans * people are increasingly victims of others.Victims of hatred, violence and social marginalization and victims of a wrong language, full of prejudices and stereotypes but, often, also of a lack of knowledge of the issues of the world t *. Specific training courses are needed, but above all a law is needed which, by filing the L.164 / 82, can truly free the trans * identities allowing their full recognition, the freedom and security they deserve.

Valis Ortíz,39.0,2022-07-17,Mexico,Mexico,19.3910038,-99.2836989,suicide,suicide,"Valis was a musician and multi-disciplinary artist. She was found dead on Sunday 17th July.

> Mexican musician and multi-disciplinary artist Valiz Ortíz was found dead on Sunday, July 17. She was 39 years old. The news broke on Monday afternoon (July 18) after close friends began sharing condolences messages on social media in an outpour of grief that has highlighted two decades of the artist’s visionary, influential, and extensive body of work.
> 
> Hailing from Monterrey, Nuevo León, Ortíz became closely associated with the city’s experimental indie boom of the late 2000s that saw the rise of her band Bam Bam, as well as Selma Oxor, White Ninja, NRMAL, and underground venue El Garage. Ortíz was a prolific singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer, an authority in Mexican psych music with detours into ambient and noise, and her work extended far beyond Bam Bam into projects like Ruidos en el Techo, Hypnomango, and XYX. In 2017, she relocated to Mexico City and launched Manitas Nerviosas, a new project melding her psychedelic visions with DIY electronic textures.
> 
> Valis Ortíz was a proud trans woman, and Manitas Nerviosas became a canvas for her ongoing metamorphosis. “Tu Carita Toda Hermosa” captured an existential shift for the artist where she shed the pseudonym “Mou,” by which fans and colleagues had known her for many years. She later legally changed her name to Valis (Vast Active Living Intelligence System), inspired by Philip K. Dick’s 1981 novel of the same name. She frequently collaborated with fellow trans artists such as Alda Arita, Luisa Almaguer, and Sofia Moreno; the latter a co-director on her music video for “Pármenux” from her buoyant final album A Love Supermeme. She was also an outspoken critic of TERFs (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists), a stance she immortalized with devilish gusto on “[Terfs R’ Nazis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GWxkFkWx8)”.
> 
> Beyond her own musical work, Ortíz was an active part of labels such as Nene Records and Oris Label.  She was also an architect and talented illustrator, releasing numerous zines and with much of her visual work still available on Tumblr. Humor, criticism, and raw honesty intersected across her work, making this an immeasurable loss for Mexican experimental music and underground art.

She was the second trans woman to be killed in the area in less than a month. The previous victim was an unidentified trans woman killed on 20th January.

Activists suspect that an extermination group in Concordia do Pará is acting to kill gays and lesbians in the interior. “It was a death tied to homophobia. In less than a month they killed two trans there, and there is information that this group is acting strongly, “says the coordinator.

Niharika Narasimhamurthy,35.0,2021-03-20,Karnataka,India,14.11474095,76.97712746,violence,stabbed and burned,"Niharika was reportedly killed by two men who left her body by a roadway.

> Thirty-five-year-old Transgender woman Niharika Narasimhamurthy was reportedly burned alive by two men Saturday morning and left by a roadway.
> 
> Niharika Narasimhamurthy’s body was found alongside the Hindupur-Sira Highway Saturday morning with her throat slit and half burnt.
> 
> The police say that they are looking for two suspects, Rajasekhar and Hanumanthappa. According to the police, Rajasekhar was the victim’s longtime friend and lover. They say he used to visit often until his wife became suspicious. To ally his wife’s fears he killed Niharika first slicing her throat then dousing her with gasoline to set her afire.
> 
> The Hindu, which first reported on this, predictably told a different story. The Hindu wrote that Niharika was a working girl who died trying to extort her client for money. According to that narrative, Rajasekhar refused to pay her so Niharika threatened to out him. This ‘put him a spot’ so he killed her.
> 
> That would be a lot to assume since the killers hadn’t been caught. But it isn’t unexpected as it fits a pattern well established by Indian media. India’s transgender people will never stand a chance of achieving the level of equality guaranteed by their constitution and courts until the press and police treat them respectfully.
> 
> Even if the police had relayed that story to them as the Hindu claims, Niharika Narasimhamurthy at a minimum deserves both dignity in death and a fair trial.
> 
> Rest in Peace Niharika Narasimhamurthy. You deserve better than this.

> Bike-borne youths gunned down Sumana Dhar, a transgender person, when she was about to step into her house in Sabitri Pally in Nimta, about 16km north from the heart of Calcutta, on Sunday evening.
>
> Sumana was a prominent voice within the community, who would protest against alleged wrongdoings by some of the members in Birati, Nimta and adjoining areas. Some of those who knew the 32-year-old said Sumana used to attend meetings and conferences on transgender rights and tried to persuade several of the community members not to engage in infighting.
>
> In Nimta, Sumana organised small meetings to try and influence some of the community members to refrain from certain activities that create a wrong impression about transgender people in public minds, police said.
>
> “Sumana came across as a very upright individual who wanted to reform some members of the community across parts of North 24-Parganas,” said Ranjita Sinha, a transgender activist and former member of the West Bengal Transgender Welfare Board. “This murder sends out very disturbing signals for our community.”
>
> The police said four youths came riding motorcycles around 7pm and fired four bullets from close range, leaving Sumana in a pool of blood on the road leading to her house, which is located in an area under North Dum Dum Municipality.

Two people were subsequently arrested.

> The Biobío Regional Prosecutor's Office ordered the PDI Homicide Brigade to investigate the death of a trans woman in Concepción after being injected with chemical products for cosmetic purposes.
> 
> According to initial information, the death of the trans woman occurred inside her home. A man had traveled from the Metropolitan Region to the regional capital of Biobío to apply the silicone injection.
> 
> The prosecutor in charge, Jorge Lorca, pointed out that “ Carabineros reported that a 36-year-old person inside a home who had apparently undergone cosmetic [filler] injections but had felt ill in the afternoon. She did not go to any health care center and when SAMU arrived, this person died. We are investigating the substance involved.”
> 
> The Amanda Jofré Trans People's Union pointed out that the victim was a trans woman from Concepción who did not manage to legally process her gender change and had to resort to this type of illegal surgeries, since they are “Very expensive and difficult to access” by regular means.
> 
> “For trans women, part of having a healthy transition is also being able to perform aesthetic interventions in a safe and comprehensive way for our community. Part of feeling safe with who we are is feeling good about ourselves; with the mind, body and soul”, concluded the Amanda Jofré Trans People's Union.

> Soledad Rojas Paúcar (48), also known as Shisha, was murdered on November 12 in her “Rojas” mini-market located in block 19 of Mariscal Castilla, in the district of El Tambo, Huancayo, Sierra del Peru. They found her inside her premises stabbed in the neck and nape.
> 
> According to initial investigations, there had been a previous meeting at the victim's premises. Shisha did not appear to have resisted the attack, so it is thought that the perpetrator might have been someone known to her. The murderer stole her savings of approximately 7 thousand sols. Neighbors point out that despite the fact that the location is close to the Municipality, there are no surveillance cameras on the streets that could help to find Shisha's killer.
> 
> Shisha was a hard worker who was integrated into her community and well-liked. She used to sell mazamorras and chicha at local fairs and participated in local festivities as a tunantera (a typical dance in the region). During the pandemic, she had rented her premises to sell groceries.

Soledad is one of those remembered in [*""Resistiendo por Justicia""*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHSYsCWsATM) by *Proyecto Cancionar* (""The Song Project""):

> A group of feminist activists will join their voices in a collective song called ""Resistiendo por Justicia"", as a call for justice in the cases of gender violence that have taken place in the country. It will take the form of publicity both through social networks and artistic performances in public places.
>
> The 19 voices who will perform the song were selected after a call through social networks. As a result 10 musicians, a feminist [batucada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batucada), musical techniques and graphic artists will take part.
>
> The activists will meet and perform at 3pm [on 25th November] in Don Bosco Park in In Huancayo. At 6pm there will be a vigil in the Plaza de la Constitución.

> Soledad Fernández, 42, was murdered on Monday, October 7 at night behind Villa del Sol, a closed condominium on the way to the town of Zanja Pyta, a neighbor of Pedro Juan Caballero (Amambay). Soledad, trans who towards the end of his life asked to be renamed Marcelino Soler, was accompanied by Leonardo Miranda De Oliveira when a hooded cis man began to follow them. According to Miranda's later statements, the man told them it was an assault but immediately shot Soledad.

Panambí activist Yren Rotela said the following about the victim:

> “I met Soledad in 2009 because I was a reference for Panambi in Pedro Juan Caballero at that time. That year she was doing a job with the population there. She was also a health promoter, I know she went through many things, ”said Yren and said that since she became involved in evangelism she began to change her gaze towards the collective. In the Church they told her that because she was a [trans woman], ""he lived as he lived."" 
>
> “I understand that when one clings to life looking for some way to survive. Many times, when you live in a context, being trans women, we have no work alternative, we have no studies and we have to endure a lot of violence, discrimination. Doors close on you a lot. She went into depression and sought refuge in spirituality. Which seems very good to me, but that made her return to her socially affected male identity, ”recalls Yren.

The road was blocked in both directions by the protesters at around 6:20 pm, complicating traffic on the stretch, which is quite busy at this peak time. 
>
> A team from the Mogi Municipal Guard arrived at the place around 6:50 pm and soon received reinforcements, but the protesters - who ""seek justice for Nataly"" - refused to clear the avenue. Military Police (PM) and Urban Ostensive Round (Romu) officers were called - heavily armed - who talked to the participants. One driver broke through the blockade, running over one of the protesters, causing bruises to one of their legs. Other drivers chose to use alternative routes. 
>
> Participants in the protest carried placards asking for ""justice"" for Nataly and dressed white T-shirts.  At 7:10 pm the occurrence was accompanied by three police vehicles and seven from the Municipal Guard of Mogi. In dialogue with the Protestants, the teams released a banner in each direction. The crowd started to disperse around 7:30 pm. Participants walked the route peacefully. 

In February 2021 a court ordered that the alleged assailants Vanessa Silva Vieira, Danilo Nascimento Batista (known as ""Cocão""), Caio Cleiton Rodrigues Silva (known as branquinho) and Carlos Renato Rodrigues Silva (known as ""Gó"") be detained in prison.

In August 2018 [Vanessa Campos](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2018/08/17/vanessa-campos_bois-de-boulogne-paris-france_ebdadf72) had been killed nearby.

> A transgender [sex worker] from the Bois de Boulogne was crushed on the night of Thursday to Friday in Paris. Around 2:25 a.m. on allée de la reine Marguerite, a car with three suspects on board ran into the victim, who has not yet been formally identified. According to initial reports, the manoeuvre was deliberate.
>
> The emergency services were alerted by two witnesses. When briefly questioned, they said that a Renault Clio with no lights had driven at high speed towards the victim (who was on the road) and then driven away without stopping.

> The victim died at around 2:40 am in the hands of the emergency services and her body was taken to the medico-legal institute in Paris. Investigators from the first judicial police district are responsible for carrying out an investigation.

> The police discovered some debris from the killer car. At the end of the night, a Clio which could correspond to the description given by the witnesses was found abandoned in the XXth arrondissement of Paris.

After Jessyca's murder Acceptess Transgenres released the following [statement](https://www.facebook.com/acceptess.transgenres/?eid=ARAcF3LT6DPoRb_XjZCXc7bIPn-akNED5XkW2lYOE5M2eO1euCL5WX-X5JFWFjQrCVKe3J7s9hfNxzWg):

> **Death of Jessyca Sarmiento**
> **ACCEPTESS TRANSGENRES · FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2020**
>
> We are once again in the sadness of the discovery of the death of one of our own. On the night of February 20-21, Jessyca Sarmiento was killed at her workplace, knocked down by a car traveling at high speed in an alley in the Bois de Boulogne. The first elements of the investigation communicated by the press indicate that the car which struck it did not even stop. We are particularly dismayed by the possibility that this act was deliberate. An investigation has been opened and must shed light on the circumstances of this new tragedy. But it also calls for a response from the political class.
>
> Today, as it was two years ago after the assassination of Vanessa Campos, we are once again shocked by the death of one of our sisters, comrades, and colleagues. Our pain and suffering are indescribable. And our anger too. We know that we are going to have to fight against the enterprise of media trivialization already at work, in Le Parisien , whose first publication announced as usual the death of “a transvestite prostitute”, in a “high place of male prostitution”. Jessyca was a trans woman, sex worker, migrant, and she was killed at her workplace. We are dismayed to notice that the first reflex of the press is still, to stigmatize.
>
> In France, in 2020, it is still possible to think that assaulting trans people, assaulting sex workers are acts that can leave their perpetrators with a certain feeling of impunity, even pride, because they leave to their spectators a feeling of indifference, even of approval. We immerse ourselves in horror, in sadness, and in the constantly renewed bitter observation that our lives are worth so much less than those of others.
>
> Jessyca was a trans Peruvian woman, who came to France last year and, like all of us, aspired to a better life in this country. She had been followed for the first time by an abolitionist prostitution association, which had failed to ensure her care. She then turned to Acceptess-T. She benefited in our association from social, legal, health and administrative support, but she also found there a place of refuge and mutual aid, emotional and human support. Last month, she had started to participate in our French lessons, she was studious, applied, and generous, bringing to each session the meal for her comrades. She was “the driving force behind the group,” according to her teacher. She was preparing for the association's monthly celebration, scheduled for February 28. She had come to France to work and live there. She worked there and lived there for a year. And we cannot bear the idea that she died there for these reasons.
>
> We are already in contact with her family in Peru, and we are making the necessary arrangements so that they can come quickly to Paris. We are organizing a vigil this evening at 11 p.m. at the Bois de Boulogne. We call on our loved ones, our comrades, our colleagues and all those who can and who think that our lives deserve so much better, to join us at this gathering.

Two days later the police arrested two people at a bus stop in Ghaziabad.

> Uttar Pradesh Police on Monday claimed to have solved the murder case of transgender Daya Rani Kinnar with the arrest of two accused.
> 
> After investigation, Waris and Nadim were arrested from old Ghaziabad bus stand around 5.30 pm, Circle officer City 1st, Anil Kumar Yadav said, adding that their accomplice Sameer is still at large.
> 
> A country-made pistol, which was allegedly used to shoot her, and a knife have been recovered from their possession, he said.
> 
> During interrogation, the duo confessed that they murdered Daya Rani to usurp her wealth.
> 
> Also, Waris held a grudge against Daya after he got married to her niece Geeta, much against her (Daya's) wish. Later, Daya she let Geeta and her child stay at her house but did not allow Waris, he said.

Daya had always lived in Dasna, Ghaziabad. She lived with other trans women in a shared bungalow. 

> Although illiterate, in 2004, 2009 and 2014 Daya Rani contested the Ghaziabad Lok Sabha constituency in the General Election as an independent. In 2007 she ran for the Uttar Pradesh assembly. She stressed her gender identity: 
> 
> ""Why are people with me? Because other politicians fill their homes and cupboards. And I have no children, husband, wife or heirs. Whatever family I have is these people and I live off these people and I will fight for these people with the politicians who have not delivered on their promises.""

> Most of the news articles refer to Daya Rani as ""Daya Rani Kinnar"". However 'kinnar' is a local word for 'hijra'. Thus it is like referring to ""Sylvia Rivera Transgender"". Not a good practice. Not at all!

We ask and demand that all authorities investigate, that Justice be done for Chinina, and that their transvestite not be unpunished.”

Nikki Kuhnhausen,17.0,2019-12-07,California,United States of America,40.657234,-121.465058,violence,murdered,"Nikki was killed by David Bogdanov after he discovered that she was transgender while they were on a date on 6th June. Her skeletal remains were found on 7th December.

> VANCOUVER, Wash. (KATU) – Police arrested a 25-year-old accused of murdering a transgender teenager who has been missing since June.
>
> Investigators said they believe 18-year-old Nikki Kuhnhausen was killed after revealing to the suspect, David Bogdanov, that she was [assigned male at birth].
>
> On December 7, someone found Nikki's remains while collecting bear grass on Larch Mountain in a remote part of northeast Clark County. Detectives say Bogdanov had allegedly been talking with Kuhnhausen on Snapchat and planned to meet on June 6, when she was last seen alive. Authorities say cell phone records for that day show Bogdanov's cell phone was in the same remote area where her body was found.
>
> “We suspect that there was probably some interaction where - and by his own admission - that he determined that, somehow found out during conversation that she was transgender and he stated that he - that was offensive to his culture and he asked her to get out of his van,” said Lieutenant Tom Ryan of the Vancouver Police Dept. Major Crimes Unit.
>
> During an interview with detectives, Bogdonov said he and Nikki had been together in early June, they ""had a conflict"" and he asked Nikki to get out of his van. Bogdonov told them that Nikki walked away and he never saw her after that.

Nikki was from Vancouver in nearby Washington State. She was 17 at the time she disappeared, but by the time her body was found she would have been 18. The date she died has not been confirmed, but cell phone records on the day of her disappearance put her alleged killer in the area where her body was later found.

David Bogdanov, 25, was arrested on suspicion of murder.
 
> Investigators said they believe Bogdanov met Kuhnhausen the morning she disappeared, killed her, and may have driven his white van - or one like it - up to Larch Mountain.
>
> ""The cause of death is always found by the medical examiner's office. There was some evidence that indicates at least the potential of some strangulation involved,"" Lt. Ryan said.
>
> Bogdanov is expected to make his first appearance on second-degree murder charges Wednesday morning at the Clark County courthouse.

On 27th August 2021 Bogdanov was convicted of second degree murder and malicious harassment. Two weeks later on 9th September he was sentenced to 20 years in jail.

> A jury in Washington state found David Bogdanov, 27, guilty on Friday of killing transgender 17-year-old Nikki Kuhnhausen in 2019. The pair had connected on Snapchat before meeting up but Bogdanov flew into a rage after discovering she was transgender during a sexual encounter in the back of his car. He strangled her with the cord of a cellphone charger; her body was discovered six months later in forestland. Bogdanov claimed he acted in self-defense because Kuhnhausen reached for his gun during a struggle, but the jury didn’t buy his version of events. Kuhnhausen’s death led to the passage of the Nikki Kuhnhausen Act in Washington, which outlaws use of the so-called “panic defense” in LGBTQ+ homicides. Bogdanov was convicted of second-degree murder and malicious harassment, which is a hate crime in Washington.

> The naked and bound body of a Turkish citizen found on Sunday afternoon after police broke down the door to her apartment has been reported as being a 35-year-old transsexual asylum seeker.
According to a press release from the asylum rights organization Asylum in Need, the transgender woman was not allowed to work, and therefore had turned in desperation to prostitution to support herself. 
> 
> The organization criticized the current asylum system, saying that through a ""lack of alternatives she was forced to look into the sex trade"". 
> 
> They further called for basic social support for asylum seekers, ""from which one can live and is not forced into the underground economy or sex work"".
> 
> According to an autopsy report from Monday, the victim was most likely strangled. Her hands had been tied behind her back, and she was found naked with a cloth ligature around her neck.

A month later a 32-year-old Serbian was arrested in connection with her murder after DNA analysis matched his profile.

He had recently robbed a sex worker at a Thai massage studio in Ottakring, and a day later he robbed an alternative healer in Vienna.  The latter was able to give an accurate description of the suspect, allowing police to make a quick arrest. The suspect was already in custody for the armed robbery of the 54-year-old healer, when Hande's body was found.

After being presented with the DNA evidence, the suspect made a full confession. He claimed to be short of money and had murdered Hande during a robbery.

A. G.,38.0,2021-10-31,T'bilisi,Georgia,41.7060737,44.7874403,violence,stabbed,"A. G. died after being stabbed in the throat by a customer at the massage centre where she worked. She was a Thai national who had arrived in Georgia only two weeks earlier.

> Georgian law enforcers have arrested one individual for stabbing a [Thai] transgender woman in a massage parlor in central Tbilisi late on October 31. 
>
> The woman died at the scene, while another employee of the massage centre, who was also stabbed by the same 23-year-old man, is now undergoing treatment in a clinic in Tbilisi. Doctors say that the health condition of the patient is stable. 
>
> Massage centre employees told journalists that the deceased woman was a 38-year-old Thai citizen who came to Georgia two weeks ago. 
>
> They said that three individuals came to the massage centre on Sunday and left after some time. One of the three individuals, who was allegedly denied a particular service, returned with a knife and stabbed both victims.
>
> Police did not say whether the detainee is a citizen of Georgia, only that he was arrested in Tbilisi. He has been charged with premeditated murder, which is punishable by 7 to 15 years in prison.


The assailant had apparently asked for ""additional services"" from the victim, which she refused.

> New details in the case of the murder in Vera - a 38-year-old transgender woman killed on Akhvlediani Street. The ""Courier"" exclusively filmed the scene - a massage center where a Thai citizen worked. Another woman was injured. The woman was rushed to a clinic shortly after the accident and was soon discharged due to her health condition. He is already at a Thai massage center, though he has a hard time remembering what happened late last night.
> 
> Other employees of the center recall the incident in detail. They say that a confrontation took place between the massage specialist and the customer, after the customer requested additional services in addition to the massage, which he was refused. 
> 
> ""Everything happened very quickly, someone knocked, the girl opened the door, then a man stabbed her in the throat. We did not know this man before, we had not seen him. It happened, we know nothing more. The dead girl had no problem with anyone, she was a very good person."" - says one of the employees of the center.

Her phone and purse were missing, and witnesses reported seeing a man leaving the area on foot.

> Kandis Capri, also known as [deadname], was shot multiple times on Aug. 11 and her body was found in a parking lot at La Reserve Apartments at 2627 N. 45th Ave. A suspect was seen leaving the area on foot, police said.
> 
> Capri was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.
>
> According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), Kandis Capri, 35, was one of 16 transgender people to be murdered in the US this year.
> 
> “The only thing I know [for sure] is that my [daughter] was murdered,” Andria Gaines, Capri’s mother, told the Guardian. “[Kandis] was shot and I don’t know all the circumstances.”
> 
> Gaines continued: “[Capri] was at a lady’s apartment who [she] had been staying with for a couple of weeks. And the only thing I know is that the car [she] had rented had been towed or something, or suspected of being towed away, so [she] left her apartment and was shot.”

A vigil was held for her on 19th August.

> I took a moment to read some of the comments on the FB post announcing this vigil and I came across this, ""How does this happen in Phoenix?""  I guess it's nice to know some people still see Phoenix as a place where violence against the LGBT community doesn't happen.  This person must be new to the city or totally unaware of what's been happening here.  Please check out some of the links below as a reminder of just how ""welcoming"" our city is for LGBT folks. [Let it be noted: I do not think our city is exceptionally violent toward our community.  I just think that homophobia and violence towards the LGBT community exists here as it does everywhere else].

Kandis was just getting her life back together after transition. She had started attending church and enrolled in theology classes at South Mountain Community College.

In time she may have become a faith leader in the LGBT+ community, but instead she became yet another of our community whose loss we mourn.

What an absolutely terrible waste of a young life.

> 
> His mother Claire Lowe said her son had told to her about a month before his death, he had to be referred to an adult clinic because he was turning 18.
> 
> This meant an additional two-year wait for treatment, the coroner's court heard.
> 
> Mother Claire said Jayden told her: ""I can't carry on living like this.""
> 
> She said: ""That's why we allowed him to go online to seek his solution. We backed him because he was desperate. He was just living for the day he would just be a proper boy"".

He said Jayden had been on a child and adolescent waiting list for 11 months but because he was turning 18 was not eligible and would have to wait an additional two years to be seen in an adult clinic.
>
> In a statement Jayden's father Neil Lowe, recalled how his son had good grades in all his studies, was doing A-Levels, and wanted to go on to study History of Art at Oxford University. He said from an early age Jayden wanted to be known as 'Jess' and the family were aware he was transgender. However, long waiting lists for NHS reassignment treatment had forced the teen to ""give up"" and order male hormone treatment online. He said: ""Jayden has started taking these very recently before his death.""

Jayden's death was not recorded on the official TDoR 2018 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU).

"Alejandra Benitez (""La Power"")",34.0,2020-11-05,Tucuman,Argentina,-26.84233,-65.2144797,violence,shot,"Alejandra was shot outside her home by an assailant on a motorcycle.

> Yesterday another transfemicide was known in Tucumán: Alejandra Benítez, a 34-year-old trans woman, was shot dead in the back on the sidewalk where she lived, on Avenida Roca and Ayacucho in the provincial capital. During the morning, the Homicide Prosecutor Unit No. 2 reported that a key witness had been testified. Witness accounts point to a man as the person responsible for the shooting.
> 
> ""The last we knew is that a guy got off the motorcycle, argued with her and shot her point blank,"" said Claudinna Rukone, a trans activist and friend of Alejandra. ""Apparently Alejandra was walking away when this person drew the weapon,"" says Lorenzo Franco, coordinator in Tucumán of the Association of Transsexual and Transgender Transvestites of Argentina (ATTTA).
> 
> The organization were with Alejandra's family on Wednesday. “I met Alejandra during the pandemic. She carried the needs of her companions on her shoulders and worked a lot with food parcels so that those who were having a very bad time did not lack, ”says Franco.
> 
> That of Alejandra Benítez is the second transfemicide in the province since the measures for the Covid 19 pandemic began . The previous one was that of [Vanesa Solórzano](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2020/08/11/vanessa-solorzanorotolo_san-miguel-de-tucuman-argentina_96487107), a 20-year-old girl whose body was found in the Canal Sur area in San Miguel de Tucumán. Alejandra and Vanesa earned their daily living as sex workers, as did so many [trans women] who suffer structural violence and lack of access to basic rights. Neither of them reached the average age of life of a trans person in Latin America: 35 years.

Alejandra was one of the founders of [Trans Unidas](https://www.facebook.com/Trans-Unidas-Tucum%C3%A1n-104441481209094/), had a reputation for being cheerful and was well loved in her community.

> Alejandra Benítez was also Alejandra Power or, simply, La Power, as she was known around here. Among the younger trans women, they called her Godmother or Mother because she was the one who accompanied and advised them in the transgender transition process. “ In the neighborhood, the girls called her mom. She was a spokesperson and godmother for the younger trans. She cared for them and protected them. They were very companions of hers and now they are all destroyed, ”says Federico. Alejandra was a sex worker and one of the creators of the group Trans Unidas whose objective is to make visible all the demands and needs of the community of trans women in the province. During the pandemic, Alejandra helped collect merchandise for trans women from Tucumán. 
>
> “She had no problem with anyone, she shared with anyone, as long as they don't disrespect her. She has always been about improving herself, about traveling. She was in solidarity with everyone here, she never forgot that she comes from a humble neighborhood. The whole neighborhood is shocked by what has happened and we feel unprotected by the state. Politicians and judges leave much to be desired, those who represent us are killing us”, reflects Federico. 

In June 2021 Ricardo Puenzo was acquitted through lack of evidence.

> The trial for the transfemicide of Alejandra Estefanía La Power Benítez has concluded after a week of deliberations. Unanimously, the court comprised of Judge María Balcazar (president), Judge Rafael Marorito and Judge Isabel Menéndez, acquitted Ricardo Puenzo, the only accused of the crime.
>
> In their summing up, they pointed to the Public Prosecutor's Office, under the charge of prosecutor Carlos Sale, for deficiencies in the investigation that did not manage to gather enough evidence to determine with certainty that Puenzo was responsible for the six shots that killed the young trans woman or the four who injured Diego Mercado.
>
> “Unfortunately, due to the way in which this case was investigated, it is not possible to reach full certainty and conviction that Ricardo“ Ricky ”Puenzo was the author of the shots that caused the death of Alejandra Estefanía Benítez and injured Diego Ramos Mercado”, read Judge Menéndez in the public hearing followed by more than 100 people who were waiting attentively for the verdict.
>
> Mercado was a key witness of the trial and on whom the prosecution had relied for evidence to locate Puenzo, not only at the scene of the event, but as the material author of the crime, since he had affirmed this in the statements he gave to the prosecution. However, during the trial his testimony changed and he then maintained that when he was shot he was facing away and could not be sure who had fired.
>
> As a result, the court gave rise to the prosecution's request for Mercado to be investigated for false testimony.
>
> The magistrates launched strong criticism of the investigation of the incident, blaming the homicide prosecutor, Sale, and the police for having followed only one line of investigation and for having ruled out other lines of investigation, such as Benítez's ex-partner, for being a gender crime.

> A teenager took her own life after being told of an Instagram post that had circulated around her Oxfordshire school, an inquest heard. Emma Boland, 15, was said to have been caused ‘great upset’ by the social media post on January 17, the precise nature of which was not set out by senior coroner Darren Salter this afternoon.
> 
> A fellow pupil described the girl, who was born Christopher Boland and was in the process of transitioning from male to female, holding her ‘head in her hands’ and saying the Instagram post had been ‘misunderstood’.
> 
> Oxford Coroner’s Court heard the teenager returned home to the house she shared with her parents and brother in Bampton at around 3.20pm then left to see a friend about 10 minutes later.
> 
> When their daughter had not returned by 6.30pm, her parents tried to contact her and her friends. Her mother, Rachel, ‘found out something had happened at school that day and it was concerning social media’, the inquest heard. She rang the police and reported Emma missing. Her father, Stuart, discovered his daughter by Shill Brook, around a 20 minute walk from her home. A post-mortem gave the cause of the girl’s death as hanging.
> 
> In a statement summarised by the coroner, Mr Boland said Emma had previously struggled with poor mental health. Shortly before Christmas 2021, a few weeks before her death, she decided she wanted to be known as Emma and began the process of transitioning from male to female. “Everyone was very supportive,” her father said. The girl was reportedly a high-achieving student.
> 
> The family spent the weekend before her death on Monday, January 17, ‘watching films and building Lego’ together. Her father said: “Emma seemed really happy.”
> 
> Emma did not have her phone with her at school on the Monday. However, she was said to have become aware of the Instagram post circulating among pupils at her school during the day. The post, which did not name anyone directly, was said by Mr Salter to have ‘included details of a past personal relationship that Emma had with a girl of the same age previously’.
> 
> One fellow pupil, a 15-year-old boy said Emma told them the post had been ‘misunderstood’ and had her ‘head in her hands’. Another said Emma had asked if she could see the post and said ‘there were some things true, others not’. She was ‘very down in the dumps about it’, he added.
> 
> The post was reported to Joe Winter, deputy headteacher at Faringdon Community College, on January 17 by the Year 11 lead, who had been approached by a pupil. Mr Winter was said to have decided that an investigation into the post would continue the following day. The school was informed shortly before 8pm that Emma had been reported missing.
> 
> Recording a conclusion of suicide, Mr Salter said it appeared Emma had intended to take her own life but that it had happened ‘in the context of…what appears to be great upset and that, of course, is very, very regrettable indeed’.

> LAKEWOOD, Ohio (WJW) — Lakewood police are investigating after a woman was struck and killed by a train on Sunday.
> 
> According to the department, officers were notified around 4:45 p.m. that someone had been hit by a westbound train. While searching the area, they discovered a woman’s body near the railroad tracks just west of [1313] Cove Avenue.
> 
> No other details about the incident were made available.

Eliana Turan, Director Of Development at The LGBT Community Center of Greater Cleveland said:

> ""Transgender woman Rukia Isis Bemer died around the same time as Lea. The authorities found her body on railroad tracks in the inner Cleveland suburb of Lakewood, very near where I live. She was only 22.
> 
> We still do not know if she died of suicide, or if it was an accident or foul play. Most of the media coverage focused on Lea’s death [[Lea Rayshon Daye](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2020/08/30/lea-rayshon-daye_cleveland-ohio-usa_4cd1c044), who died the same day in Cleveland], so we don’t know very much about Rukia’s passing.""

According to the police report, video recorded from the train shows her walking eastbound towards the westbound train - with her head up and wearing earphones. The train blew its whistle continuously before hitting her.

Victoria Alejandra Ironici,43.0,2022-08-21,Santa Fe,Argentina,-31.5826867,-60.7425532,violence,stabbed and burned,"Alejandra was killed in her home, allegedly by her partner. The Prosecutor's Office is investigating her death as transfemicide.

> SANTA FE CITY, Santa Fe. The Santa Fe trans figure, Alejandra Ironici, was murdered in her home – Public Passage 8133 -, in the northwest of the city. She was 43 years old and was the coordinator of the Movement for Social, Ethnic and Religious Integration (MISER) Santa Fe. Alejandra was the promoter of important advances in human rights for the trans community and was the first to receive her DNI with the registration change, as well as to access a teaching position in the State of Santa Fe, among other actions.
> 
> This Sunday, August 21, around 11 pm, Alejandra's nephew - who lives in the same house - returned from work, and when he entered there was a fire in the bedroom. Upon entering, according to what he stated to the Police, he found his aunt with signs of burns and in a pool of blood. He immediately called 911. When the police arrived at the scene, they confirmed that the victim was already dead. They began the operation to preserve the scene of the incident and asked for experts and a health unit to attend (which never arrived).
> 
> After a check of the house, the young man alerted the Police that his aunt's car, a GRAY FIAT PALIO, was not in the garage. Alejandra's current partner, with whom she had had a relationship for about five months, was also missing. This morning, they found Alejandra's car in Padre Dusso at 7200 in the city of Santa Fe. A person was also arrested at the same location. The detainee is a 32-year-old man, whose initials are DHB and was Alejandra's current partner, and the arrest occurred in a house in front of which the victim's car was found.
> 
> The case is being investigated by the Santa Fe Femicide Brigade, in charge of the prosecutor Alejandra Del Río Ayala. In the next few hours, he will request the Office of Judicial Management to set the day and time for the impeachment hearing of the detainee.
> 
> In March 2018, after two transfemicides perpetrated in the capital of Santa Fe and the area - that of Adriana Cuqui Bonetto and that of Sol - it was Alejadra Ironici who explained to Presentes: ""Most trans women in the city and its surroundings live alone and in peripheral areas, which deepens their situation of vulnerability.”
> 
> Victoria Alejandra Ironici had many titles. Her life was one of struggle and, above all, achievement. She was the first trans woman to get a DNI that respects her identity, even before the law guaranteed that right for everyone. If all the actions in which she was a pioneer began to be enumerated, the list would include all the claims achieved by the Santa Fe transvestite collective.
> 
> Her story of struggle begins at the age of 18, when she was kicked out of her house for being trans. She came from Vera to Santa Fe capital to find more opportunities. In 2007, after losing a job, she began the administrative process for the province of Santa Fe to recognize her identity. In 2010, two months before the Gender Identity Law was sanctioned, a ceremony was held at Government House. The then Governor Antonio Bonfatti gave her her corrected birth certificate and DNI.
>
> Last year, Alejandra and Lucy Gimenez became the first trans teachers to agree to substitute classes in secondary schools in the city. “It is the fundamental door of what we have been fighting for: the educational system had to be with us. In that process we had been working with Lucy to break that social prejudice. Today we have to do it from within the schools, already as teachers, ”she said on that occasion.

Alejandra was a teacher, activist and a pioneer among the Santa Fe LGBT+ community.

> “My new life begins. I will go out with my head held high, proud of who I am . Without having to hide, because I did not commit any crime. All I did was choose a different life. That meant that I was denied a lot of rights , ”she said that day when she began to be Victoria Alejandra Ironici. ""I wanted Selenia as a third name but she will have to stay as my stage name,"" she joked.
> 
> That day she also told his next goals: to get a job and have a vaginoplasty. She met both goals and continued to break new ground. In 2013, she was the first trans woman to undergo the surgical procedure through the social work of the province and in a hospital in Buenos Aires.
> 
> Alejandra was a great promoter of the trans quota at different levels of the State and national organizations. She was studying law at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral , and she was one of the promoters of the quota in that house of higher studies. 
> 
> On May 31, in an [interview with Presentes](https://agenciapresentes.org/2022/05/31/las-universidades-argentinas-avanzan-en-la-incorporacion-el-cupo-laboral-trans-travesti-y-no-binarie/) for a report on the quota in Argentine universities, she said: “On a social and cultural level, it positions us differently. Society is going to see that we want to go for more acceptance and inclusion and that the UNL gives its support, through a resolution that is the product of our project and of the national law”. That path had already been traveled with the struggle in the province and in the provincial capital.
> 
> Last year, Alejandra and Lucy Gimenez became the first trans teachers to agree to substitute classes in secondary schools in the city . “It is the fundamental door of what we have been fighting for: the educational system had to be with us.

> 
> Ale was a pioneer. She opened paths for her and for those who come after her. Every day of her life de ella was a struggle to break the 40-year life expectancy that the group has. However, she could not and today her name de ella is in the headline of that news from which she did everything to escape.

She had travelled to the town to attend the Gulf Coast Black Rodeo (GCBR) rodeo with friends.

Two days after she was killed, a 20-year-old Navy seaman in training named Dwanya Hickerson was charged with capital murder for the crime. In July 2017 he was sentanced to 40 years for murder and 15 for robbery.

> For the last several years, the media has tracked the murders of transgender women in the United States. Since its creation last summer, Broadly has followed these crimes. There are several common threads that run throughout the killings of transgender women. The killers are nearly always men, the crimes often happen in the context of a sexual or romantic relationship, and the degree of violence perpetrated on their victims is extreme. For instance, running someone over and over with a truck, or stabbing someone 119 times. In December of 2015, Broadly asked the acclaimed gender theorist Judith Butler what the extreme nature of this violence might indicate. This was her reply:
> 
> ""It indicates that we are all living in a society in which such hideous and horrible things happen, and that there is nowhere near enough media attention paid to such matters. In fact, the popular media deflects from this aspect of trans existence when it should be raising our awareness and helping us to organize a systematic resistance to such violence. Perhaps the man who drives over the trans woman time and again cannot quite make her dead enough. At a certain point, she is already dead, but he is not finished killing her. Why? It is because he wants to obliterate any trace of his own relation to that living person, obliterating a part of himself and living person at the same time. But also establishing his absolute power, and his own masculinity as the site of that power. Perhaps he is rebuilding his gender as he continues to try to take apart and efface that trans woman who never deserved to die. He is seeking as well to establish a world in which no one like her exists.""

He loved children, dancing and performing at clubs. He was also passionate about doing hair and even taught himself how to braid extensions at the age of four. His mother, Rebecca, said that he was so talented he could “turn a frog into a princess.” She also added that she hopes speaking out about his life and death might help someone.

> 
> Camila did not return to her house on 30 January and Presentes is working on two hypothesis of what happened.
> 
> One of the hypothesis is that Camila’s fellow sex workers attacked her. But a number of those sex workers told Presentes that they saw police attack Camila and dump her body several kilometers away from where she worked.

> ‘Presentes has asked police for an official response but it has closed the case and has not responded,’ the organization said in a statement.
> 
> Camila’s body was found on Thursday 31 January and was taken to a nearby hospital where she died from her injuries three days later.

> Gloria Álvez passed away on Sunday, May 30 at the age of 78. With more than 30 years of activism for the rights of transgender people and the LGBTI community, she left an indelible legacy for new generations: the creation of the Sex Work Law (17.515), the Right to Gender Identity Law Violence:Lorrane de Souza (Petrolina - 19 Aug 2021)(18,620) and, more recently, the Comprehensive Law for Trans Persons (19,684). As a result of her participation in the design of these laws, for her tireless activism for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and her battle against the sexual exploitation of girls, boys and adolescents she was recognized nationally and internationally.
> 
> In 1990 Gloria founded the first trans collective in the country, whose name was the Transvestite Coordination Board, currently called the Uruguayan Trans Association (ATRU). She was its president and then its secretary. In recent years, she has also worked as the Uruguayan coordinator of the Latin American and Caribbean Network of Trans People (Redlactrans).
> 
> Gloria was a survivor. She went through the Children's Council in Salto, where she suffered abuse and mistreatment, was also confined in the Salto hospital and, during the dictatorship and post-dictatorship, resisted the confinement and torture imparted by police and military to trans people, called by they ""passive pedophiles."" In 1954, she served as a ""guinea pig"" for the doctors who applied the so-called ""sexual conversion therapy"", which consisted of giving electric shocks, recalled the Frente Amplio deputy Ana Olivera, who paid tribute to her in Parliament on Wednesday.

Vida Bruno,44.0,2021-04-06,Bahia,Brazil,-12.9920828,-38.4761597,violence,beaten,"Vida died in hospital on 6th April - allegedly as a result of head injuries sustained during an attack in a restaurant the previous November.

> Family members of the Coordinator of Policies and Promotion of LGBT Citizenship of the Municipality of Salvador, Vida Bruno, are going to call on the Public Ministry to reopen the investigation against the owners of the restaurant Cervantes, in the capital of Bahia, due to an episode of aggression reported by him before of his death.
> 
> Vida Bruno passed away at the age of 44 on Tuesday (6), after two months in the Teresa de Lisieux Hospital. According to administrator Elton Bruno Vida, 39, his brother was the victim of complications from a head trauma suffered inside the restaurant. ""He was beaten up inside. The reason for his death was transphobia and racism,"" accused Elton, referring to the fact that his brother is black and a trans man.
> 
> According to his brother, Vida Bruno had to undergo surgery to remove a brain clot diagnosed in the imaging tests he did shortly after the episode, but which he hid from his family for almost two months. ""We only found out when he was admitted, after fainting and complaining of headaches,"" reports Elton.
> 
> The aggression Elton refers to occurred on November 29, 2020, when Vida Bruno was alone at the Cervantes restaurant. He ordered a bottle of water and a starter of mussels, became sick and asked a waitress for help. From there, the story takes on completely different versions.
> 
> Bruno claimed that the owner of the restaurant said that he could not be ill there and ordered his withdrawal. As he was unable to walk, he was reportedly beaten with a blow to the head and dragged to the door with the help of ""two strong men"". Outside the establishment, the aggressions continued - including repeatedly banging his head against the floor.
> 
> At the time, Bruno reported to G1 that he was knocked out for a few seconds after receiving a rear naked choke. ""When I came to, I asked to be released, said that I was a worker, that I worked in the city hall, but, even so, the other man came, caught me by the legs and threw me in the street"", he said.
> 
> When the owner realized it was a trans man, he opened his shirt and exposed his breasts saying: 'This is not a man! This is a black bitch. ""
> 
> Vitor Viana, the lawyer for the restaurant, says that Vida Bruno had a seizure with bleeding from the nose and was immediately rescued by Cervantes employees and by two doctors who were at the scene. Disoriented, he left the establishment kicking the furniture and refused to be helped by Samu.
> 
> The family, however, says he had no history of a seizure. ""What happened was food poisoning, and this does not cause a seizure, a state of mental disorientation. Much less the picture of aggression reported by their lawyer,"" counters Elton.

Vida was a historian and the coordinator of Policies and Promotion of LGBTI + Citizenship for the City of Salvador. He had actively fought for human rights, and was one of the founders of the LGBT Reference Center.

Ebeng Mayor,28.0,2021-05-20,Central Luzon,Philippines,14.7763782,121.0343974,violence,raped and beaten,"Ebeng was nonbinary. Their beaten body was found three days after they had gone missing.

Three suspects were subsequently arrested.

> Three days after going missing, Ebeng Mayor, a non-binary trans person, was found dead, bloodied, and bruised, with a wooden stick impaled in their genitals. It was believed that they were raped before being killed. Another victim, transgender woman Jhie Bangkiao, was found naked with a bloodied head in a cemetery.
> 
> Both members of the transgender community were found brutally murdered, a few days after the celebration of International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia, and Transphobia
> 
> These brutal murders are not just a loss of life– these are also crimes fueled by hate. This goes to show that the passage of the SOGIE Equality Bill is urgent. What transpired is a clear manifestation that the LGBT+ community is not safe in the country. This is not the first case of aggression and harassment towards the LGBT+ community. It is high time for the state to recognize that these are not isolated cases, rather attacks that are based on the SOGIE of the victims. We have been a target of harassment in society for a long time, and this will go on as long as perpetrators are not held accountable, and as long as the culture of violence and transphobia exists in the Philippines.
> 
> Bahaghari-UP Baguio Chapter expresses our deepest condolences to the families of the victims. We are one with the clamor for justice. Furthermore, we call on the authorities to conduct a full investigation regarding the cases of Ebeng and Junjie, and to hold those involved accountable. We also call on the government to pass the SOGIE Equality Bill immediately. The passage of the bill is set to make the country a safer space for the LGBT+ community as it ensures that crimes against the LGBT+ are held accountable.

At around midday on 27th December at around midday Phoebe went with a neighbour’s child to an informal shop in the town of Wolseley to buy iced lollies.

According to reports received by LGBTI rights group Triangle Project while there she accidentally stepped on the toes of a 15-year-old boy at the store. The furious youth responded by allegedly shouting homophobic and transphobic slurs, including “vuil moffie” (dirty faggot) at her.

After being repeatedly verbally abused by the teen, Titus told a friend’s mother across the road from the shop that she was “sick of being called names.” Annoyed, the woman picked up a plastic crate and gestured with it to the youth.

It’s alleged that a man in his twenties near the shop then handed a knife to the boy, who  plunged it into Phoebe’ neck.

Bleeding profusely, she staggered away, collapsing and dying about 500 metres down the road in a pool of blood.

> “I think she’d just had enough of being called names,” an emotional Sharon Cox, Triangle’s Health and Support Services Manager, told Mambaonline. “She was beautiful and was loved in the community. She was a hairdresser in Wolseley at the time of her death, and was a friend to many. Everybody knew her.”

"Veronica Oliveira (""Mãe Loira"")",40.0,2019-12-12,Rio Grande do Sul,Brazil,-29.6973746,-53.8210365,violence,stabbed,"Veronica was stabbed in the early hours of Thursday 12th December. She was the founder of a transgender women's housing project in her neighborhood.

> Residents of the Urlândia neighborhood, in the southern Santa Maria region, and the LGBTQ + community are disgusted by the death of Veronica Oliveira, 40 , murdered in the early hours of Thursday on Avenida Borges de Medeiros [and Avenida Presidente Vargas] in the Nossa Senhora de Fátima neighborhood. In social networks, those who met Veronica or her work, expressed regretting the crime and remembering her life.

> According to the report, Veronica's colleagues who were at the scene said that a man arrived by car and offered them $50 to make a program [have sex] with him. After they refused, the man called Veronica, who was among the group, and when she approached the vehicle he stabbed her.

> Veronica was the founder of a transgender women's housing project in the neighborhood. Veronica Alojamento was created 13 years ago and is considered a reference in Santa Maria and the state, being the only one in the city. There, she welcomed transgender women who are often expelled from home by their family and come from various locations across the country. Today about 20 girls live in the accommodation.
>
> Marquita Quevedo, founder of the NGO Equality and friend of Veronica, says that the victim's friends and family are outraged by the violent death:
>
> ""It was another big loss for the trans movement. A pitiful loss. Today we live in fear of leaving home. Every time one of us leaves home, he doesn't know if he's coming back. The climate has long been insecure in the city, especially for night workers. People find themselves entitled to kill a woman at night just because they don't accept to do a program. This is very revolting"".
>
> Marquita recalls that Veronica was known by the affectionate nickname of Mãe Loira [""Blonde Mother""], as she welcomed and took care of all of the transsexual girls in the accommodation. 

Veronica was the third trans person to be murdered in Santa Maria in 2019, the others being [Carolline Dias](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2019/09/07/carolline-dias_santa-maria-rio-grande-do-sul-brazil_f837ce95) and [Nemer da Silva Rodrigues](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2019/09/07/nemer-da-silva-rodrigues_santa-maria-rio-grande-do-sul-brazil_8130ccdd) on 7th September. After the previous two murders, Veronica had participated in a protest calling for justice and an end to homophobia.

Two days after the murder Gabriel Zanella, 28, was arrested by police and reportedly confessed to killing Veronica.

> New Orleans, LA – The Times-Picayune and Advocate.com report the Sunday murder of a victim who presented femininely and referred to herself as “Beyoncé,” in tribute to the popular star of soul and pop/rock, Beyoncé Knowles. The victim, Eric Lee, 21, was stabbed repeatedly at an apartment complex [at the 3500 block of Garden Oaks Drive] in the Algiers neighborhood. Police found Lee’s slashed body inside a first-floor apartment.
>
> Witnesses say they heard Lee arguing heatedly with a group of women before the time of the murder. While police have not announced a suspected motive for the killing, the m.o. fits a transphobic hate crime pattern. Residents who knew her say that Lee, who was in transition from male to female, often dressed in women’s clothing, and drew ridicule from the neighborhood because of it.  An unidentified source told the Times-Picayune that Lee “dressed to the nines.”  Carl Adams, who claimed that he did not know the victim well, told reporters that he had often heard Lee arguing with neighbors.  “Probably because they made fun of [her],” he said.

Three women, Perrion Crawford, Ventrice Battle and Regina Reddick were charged with second degree murder in connection with the killing.

Three weeks after the murder, Darío Jesús Chaves Rubio, 31, - a police officer - was arrested.

> Almost three weeks after the violent crime and following the analysis of security cameras in the area and the testimony of witnesses, the provincial Public Prosecutor's Office requested the arrest of the possible murderer: Darío Jesús Chaves Rubio (31), Principal Assistant of Police Station 34 of the Banking District of Godoy Cruz , who from now on must face a serious accusation.
>
> The Prosecutor of Instruction Carolina Lazo, of the Mendoza Homicide Fiscal Unit, charged him with the crime of homicide aggravated by hatred of gender expression in an ideal contest with homicide aggravated by the use of a firearm , and in a real contest for quarantine violation. This strong accusation places the cash in front of the possibility of a life sentence.
>
> Key to the arrest of the suspect was the statement of a witness who claimed to have met him before the crime and who had told him that he was going ""to look for a gun and shoot the transvestite” - clear evidence that the murder was a transphobic hate crime.

> The young woman, barely 24 years old, had suffered transphobic bullying from transgender partners and gay men from her LGBT community, which led her to death by suicide this past December 20, according to close sources consulted by the activist blog Trans Pride. He announced this unfortunate news.
> 
> As Trans Pride says:
> 
> ""Year after year transgender people, transsexuals or transvestites from all over the world end their lives because of hatred and rejection of society, in most cases of society in general but in some others that rejection comes from the same 'LGBT community' for not 'complying' with the stereotypes dictated by a normative society.
> 
> ""Chanel was a victim of ignorance, of despair and loneliness and that is why projects like Trans Pride must reach more people in this situation because we believe that together and together we can end this.
> 
> ""Transgender and transsexual women do not have to suffer this type of violence (regardless of who comes from), trans women do not have to force us to 'comply' with the stereotypes dictated by society. Our physicist does not determine the level of our femininity, transgender women are women independently of our characteristics and nobody has to violate us and hurt us by telling us otherwise.
> 
> ""Chanel's case is not a suicide, but a SOCIAL ASSASSINATION.""

> A 15-year-old who tragically died by suicide has been given two separate funerals after his parents argued over his gender in court.
> 
> The Perth schoolboy – who cannot be named for legal reasons – died on 4 March in hospital, days after attempting to take his life, Perth Now reported. After his death, the teen’s estranged parents went to the Family Court of Western Australia after they failed to agree on his funeral arrangements, including which name to put on their son’s headstone.
> 
> The boy’s father reportedly wanted his son’s deadname – the name assigned to the teen before he came out as trans – on his headstone. But his mother said she wanted to use the name her son chose when he came out as transgender.
> 
> The boy’s mother told the West Australian that her son “would hate” to be deadnamed at his memorial. She said: “[His father] wanted all the ashes [interred together] and [his son’s birth name] on the plaque.
> 
> “I would agree to have [the birth name] in brackets but his [chosen name] first.”
> 
> Eventually, the parents agreed to split their son’s ashes and put both names on any memorial plaques. However, the 15-year-old’s deadname will appear on his death certificate because, before his death, he was unable to legally change it on his birth certificate.


> Loved ones described the 15-year-old as “a good and caring friend who always listened” and an “amazing artist who was great at drawing, painting and make-up”.
> 
> When he was 14, the teen was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but his mum didn’t find out until the day before he died.
> 
> His mum said she couldn’t be sure whether knowing about the disorder would have kept him alive but said she would have given him more support.
> 
> “He needed more supervision than what he was getting,” she said.
> 
> “Risk-taking is part of BPD... if I had just known about the diagnosis ... he was only 14.”
> 
> Before his death, the boy was referred to Perth’s Gender Diversity Service, an outpatient service for children experiencing gender diversity issues.
> 
> He had also run away from home and had stopped taking his antidepressant medication.

Reports of their gender identity conflict - some sources claim Lamar was a gay man who sometimes dressed in drag, and others that Papi was a transgender woman.

> The Human Rights Campaign notes: “In addition to these murders, Lamar Edwards – whom LGBT friends have confirmed to The Advocate uses the name Lamar and identified as a gay man who sometimes dressed in drag – was fatally shot on January 9; police have not released information about whether Edwards was presenting as female at the time of death.”

> Early police and media accounts consistently misnamed and misgendered the victim, and only now are we learning that, according to BuzzFeed LGBTQ, her name was Papi Edwards and that she identified as a transgender woman.

Shortly before he died he had checked himself into hospital, but they had refused to let him wear his binder and threatened to put him in a room with ""another woman"".

> Safe Passage to young brother Mac Ohana, who was 18, and from Bellingham, Washington. Recent posts from Mac indicate that he was in crisis a few nights ago (November 26th), and he checked himself into the hospital, seeking help, only to be faced with transphobia and severe rules designed to ""convert"" or ""cure"" him of being transgender.  THIS is UNACCEPTABLE.  Mac might still be alive if he had been seen and respected when he sought help.  The treatment he received (see second photo for his own testimony) was unprofessional and, indeed, inhuman.

> I will be adding more details about Mac's life and his passing as I receive them.  It is known that his last FB post was put up on December 2.     

Western Washington University Woodring College of Education subsequently setup a scholarship programme for students aspiring to, or with experience working with, high-risk youth in his memory.

> I have been trying to get a psychiatrist/prescriber for months now. I was recommended by my counselor to see this Primary Physician through Squalicum Family Medicine for psych meds. At the time of my appointment, I was just about to get my first shot of Testosterone. The doctor was incredibly nice. She offered to take over prescribing and monitoring my Testosterone from Planned Parenthood. I was more coming to her for psych meds, but it was nice to get an all-in-one stop. Primary Care, Testosterone, AND psych meds? Sweet! She said that Testosterone is a big change, and she felt hesitant giving me psych meds right as I started. I agreed. We agreed to wait after 2 shots (two weeks) and then she'd prescribe me something. I came back to her after two shots, and suddenly she didn't want to prescribe to me anymore. She said, ""I think you should see a psychiatrist."" Uh, but you said after two shots, you'd get me an anti-depressant? Nope. I could have used those two weeks out of the months it takes to get an appointment at all with a psychiatrist. Thanks though. 
>
> Today I went to Unity Care NW (formerly Interfaith) for my appointment. Let me tell you what a bitch it was to just get one. First, I had to call the RSN line on Monday before 8am, because getting in there was super competitive and they only took 10 people a week. So I called right at 8am and got the last slot. Sweet! I was supposed to get a call from Unity Care NW that day. I didn't. So I called the next day and left a message. Didn't get a call back from them for about a week, and finally was playing phone tag with this woman in charge of intake appointments. FINALLY I got a hold of her, and she said to get a psychiatrist, I had to see a counselor through their program. I told her I already have a counselor and it's taken me a long time to establish that relationship and its annoying to have two, so I asked her to let me think about it for a few days. I called back twice a week for 3 weeks and couldn't get a hold of her after I decided. FINALLY, she scheduled me 3 weeks out for an intake. I go in there today, and I meet her for the first time and she says, ""Well, since you have a counselor already like you said over the phone, I don't think you can be in this program. You'll have to give up your counselor and see ours, or we can't take you."" BITCH! YOU MADE ME GO THROUGH ALL THIS EFFORT TO TELL ME THIS NOW?!

> oh my god. I cannot believe how much self-advocating one has to do just to get damn services. It's unbelievable. I feel so lucky to be able to be in a place in my life where I can, but what about all the people that can't? People seeking services are generally in a very vulnerable and fragile state and cannot do all of this by themselves. It's unbelievable what the system expects us to do. Mental illness can be crippling and it should not be this difficult to get services. Not at all.

“According to police, Collins hit Townsel over the head with a bottle of vodka. Townsel then retrieved the knife from her apartment that she used to stab the victim. Police records say that when Collin (sic) continued to yell at her, Townsel stabbed [her] and left [her] lying in the grass.
> 
> “One witness says Collins asked her for help and when she attempted to perform CPR, Townsel threatened her. The witness returned to her apartment to call authorities.”

> Shocking new details have surfaced about the mysterious death of transgender reality star Miriam Rivera. Miriam, who appeared on Big Brother Australia in 2004 and British dating show There’s Something About Miriam, died aged 38 in Hermosillo, Mexico on February 5.
>
> Her death wasn’t reported until this week, and Daily Mail Australia can now reveal that family members were threatened if they tried to investigate what happened.
>
> In an exclusive interview from his home in New York, Miriam’s husband Daniel Cuervo said that he suspects she met with a violent end. Mr Cuervo claimed an unknown male had called him when he was trying to arrange Miriam’s funeral and said: ‘Don’t come back to Mexico or we’ll kill you too’. He later found out her body had already been cremated, leaving no opportunity to perform an autopsy, which he found ‘very suspicious’.
>
> Because he feared for his safety, Mr Cuervo wasn’t able to arrange a proper funeral for his wife. Photos have since surfaced on Facebook of a decidedly low-key memorial service.
>
> Mr Cuervo believes his wife’s death may have been ‘passed off’ as a suicide after she refused to accept work as a prostitute for a man who was ‘infatuated’ with her. He recalled the day Miriam died: ‘On the morning of February 5, Miriam called me [in New York] from Mexico, telling me she was feeling sick and vomiting blood, so I told her to go to the hospital.
>
> ‘She called me again before leaving the hospital at 12pm and that was the last time we spoke.’. At 2pm, Miriam was found dead by hanging at her home in Hermosillo. 

In November 2021, an investigative podcast series about the series titled [Harsh Reality](https://variety.com/2021/digital/global/miriam-rivera-wondery-series-1235114091/) was released.

> Podcast studio Wondery has set up “[Harsh Reality](https://variety.com/2021/digital/global/miriam-rivera-wondery-series-1235114091/
),” a six-part investigative series on trans reality TV star Miriam Rivera’s controversial 2004 British reality dating show “There’s Something About Miriam.”
>
> The series aims to unpack the true story of the show, starring Mexican model Rivera, which aired on Sky. Set in a villa in Ibiza, the series followed six men who competed for a cash prize and for the love of Rivera. The show — produced by Remy Blumenfeld’s Brighter Pictures, which later became Remarkable under Endemol Shine U.K. — revealed she was transgender, but only in the final episode.
>
> The series is written by Agnes Borinsky and produced by Eleanor Biggs. Executive producers are Max O’Brien and Morgan M. Page for Novel and George Lavender, Marshall Lewy and Jen Sargent for Wondery. Trace Lysette, best known for her recurring role as Shea on Amazon series “Transparent,” serves as host.
>
> Lysette said: “Like many trans women from the 90s era and before, Miriam was a woman ahead of her time; a diamond in the rough that the world couldn’t appreciate in the way she deserved. I had the pleasure of knowing Miriam through NYC nightlife and the ballroom scene. She was a part of the House of Xtravaganza when I was earning my stripes in the House of Angel in the early 00’s. She was always kind to me and I feel honored to help bring this podcast about her life to the listeners. I hope she can finally be celebrated and appreciated for the pioneer that she was.”

The circumstances of her death have not yet been confirmed.

> A Black transgender woman named Elisha Chanel Stanley — better known to some as Elisha Diamond — was found dead in Downtown Pittsburgh on Sept. 16.
>
> The circumstances of Stanley’s death have not yet been determined by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner. But two weeks after her death, posts on social media claiming foul play went viral on Mon., Sept. 30, and DeVar Ferguson — a close friend of Stanley's —  believes her death is suspicious. According to Ferguson, Stanley was meant to attend a gathering Saturday evening, but never showed.
>
> Chris Togneri, public information officer for Pittsburgh’s department of safety, confirmed there is an open investigation into her death but declined to provide any further comment in an email Tuesday afternoon.
>
> According to the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s report, the victim was found deceased at the scene on Mon., Sept. 16, around 6:30 p.m., on the 1000 Block of Penn Ave., Downtown. (That address is listed as The Westin Pittsburgh hotel.) Stanley was listed on the report as a 46, female Black or African-American resident of Washington, D.C.

Elisha was a professional mental health care worker who was working for MBI Health Services LLC in Washington DC. She had gone back to Pittsburgh to be with family.

> Stanley was in Pittsburgh to visit some close friends, according to Ferguson, including themself and another of her “children."" Ferguson describes Stanley as their “gay mother.”
>
> “People don’t really understand where that term comes from,” Ferguson says. “There are a lot of runaways, and displaced and abused people in the community. Without being funded by any government organization, there are people [in this community] who have taken these people on and moved them in, clothed them, fed them, taken them to school, and really played that part as a mentor in their lives and those are all the things she did for me.”
>
> Stanley and Ferguson first met in the late '90s. At the time, Ferguson says Stanley allowed them to move in while they were living in a shelter after having been kicked out. In 2002, Stanley moved to D.C. to “become the woman she wanted to be from the inside out,” and Ferguson moved with her. Ferguson returned to Pittsburgh in 2005 and now is a father in the way Stanley was a mother to them.
>
> “She was my friend, someone who protected me, there was nothing she wouldn’t do for someone. She took me in and loved me like her own flesh and blood,” says Ferguson. “She spent her life opening doors for women like herself.”

During this period, no in-person support is offered and patients are basically left to cope on their own.

Sylva,40.0,2018-08-04,Connaught,Ireland,53.274412,-9.049063,custodial,died in custody,"Sylva was an asylum seeker who had been detained for a year.

She died in custody on 4th August 2018 in the men's wing of a Direct Provision centre in Galway.

https://twitter.com/DubTrans/status/1025373595172782080

> Just heard the heartbreaking news about a trans woman found dead in direct provision. We need to end the horrific practice of Direct Provision. Seeking asylum is not a crime so why are we locking up asylum seekers! #EndDirectProvision #DublinTransPride

In early June 2019 the local LGBT+ community discovered that the Irish authorities had buried Silva's body the previous month without notifying them or offering them the chance to hold a memorial service for her.

> On the 2nd August 2018 Sylva Tukula died. Sylva was a dear friend of the LGBT+ community in Galway city and, in particular, of AMACH! LGBT+ Galway and our resource centre, [Teach Solais](https://www.facebook.com/184455662036757/). Due to Sylva’s status as an International Protection Applicant in Ireland, the Department of Justice and Equality were obligated to investigate the circumstances of her death, to liaise with friends and fellow residents of the Direct Provision centre where she lived, and to make culturally-appropriate burial arrangements. Close friends and colleagues of Sylva were assured by both national and local State representatives that we would be notified once arrangements were made. Sadly, we were recently informed that our dear friend was buried by the State at the beginning of May. Members of our community and, especially those close to Sylva, were devastated to hear of her burial with no-one close to her present.
>
> We had the understanding that we would be made aware of the funeral arrangements in advance so that our community, Sylva’s Galway family, could be a part of this service, and to ensure that her life was celebrated on the day of her burial. We continually checked with Government representatives for updates, while receiving no new information regarding any arrangements. The fact that Sylva’s burial occurred in the absence of a ceremony, and without attendance, is deeply offensive to everyone close to Sylva, particularly members of the LGBT+ community who lived in the Great Western, who knew her from the Eglinton Direct Provision centres in Galway City and those that met her throughout her life in Galway. This abhorrent news has left many in shock, with those in the direct provision sites feeling that they will be buried alone thousands of miles away from people they grew up with by the Irish State. Anyone who has had a loved one pass away would empathise with how this has affected those that knew her, and how devastating this act would feel.
>
> We are left with more questions than answers as to how this has been allowed to occur. Our dear friend Sylva was failed by the system in which she was entrapped, in many ways; yet at all times she bore these failings with grace, with dignity and with a warm smile. We strongly request this matter be investigated both to the fullest possible extent and in a timely manner, to establish how this system failed our friend Sylva this last, final time. In her honour we must ensure that this tragic outcome does not occur again, to anyone.
>
> AMACH! LGBT+ intend to work with those who knew and loved Sylva to mark her burial and celebrate her life. We would ask that media respect the privacy of all those affected by this news. Anyone who wishes to be a part of this event is encouraged to contact us""

Ashley Sherman,25.0,2014-10-27,Indiana,United States of America,39.76845,-86.156212,violence,shot,"Ashley's body was discovered by a police officer making a traffic stop in the area. She had been shot in the head.

> The body of Ashley (nee Tajshon) Sherman was discovered on the east side of Indianapolis on Sunday evening by a police officer who was making a traffic stop in the area. Ashley was a black trans woman who identified as female according to family members, and called herself Ashley according to co-workers. She had been the victim of numerous cases of harassment and abuse, and was a runaway at age 12. Police later updated their reports with the information that Ashley had been shot in the head. Neighbors in the Tudor Park Condominiums report hearing a shot around midnight that evening.
> 
> Initial coverage of Ashley Sherman’s death was complicated by the police and local media mis-gendering her as male after initially identifying her as female, and mis-naming her as her birth name instead of her chosen name. Misreporting trans women’s murders by mis-gendering has been linked to problems with tracking murders of trans women nationwide and hampered police investigations of those murders. Mis-naming murder victims contributes to lack of police evidence as they attempt to speak to friends who might have known the victim by their chosen name but not their birth name.
> 
> GLAAD’s guidelines on trans people call for media to correctly identify and name trans people in news stories by their chosen names and gender markers.

Roxsana Hernández Rodriguez,33.0,2018-05-13,New Mexico,United States of America,35.188133,-107.894427,custodial,died in custody,"Roxsana died from dehydration 9 days after being taken into custody by US Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE).

She was a refugee from Honduras, and had fled to the USA after threats from MS-13.

> Hernández Rodriguez had told Buzzfeed, months before her death, ""she was walking home when MS-13 gang members started screaming 'We don't want you in this neighborhood, you fucking faggot' at her before gang-raping her.""
> 
> ""Four of them raped me and as a result I got HIV,"" Hernandez told BuzzFeed News. ""Trans people in my neighborhood are killed and chopped into pieces, then dumped inside potato bags.""

She was being held at the privately run Cibola Correctional Facility in Milan, New Mexico. An inquest found that her death occurred after medical treatment was withheld, and that she was most likely beaten while in ICE custody.

> The private prison facility at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico is operated by CoreCivic, the second-largest private prison company in the U.S. CoreCivic, co-founded by a former GOP chairman, operates more than 65 facilities and has come under fire for poor staffing and extensive lobbying efforts.
> 
> ""There she developed severe diarrhea and vomiting over the course of several days,"" the autopsy states, ""and finally was emergently hospitalized, then transported to Lovelace Medical Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she remained critically ill until her death.""
> 
> ""According to observations of other detainees who were with Ms. Hernández Rodriguez, the diarrhea and vomiting episodes persisted over multiple days with no medical evaluation or treatment, until she was gravely ill,"" forensic pathologist Kris Sperry wrote.
> 
> The autopsy ""also found evidence of physical abuse, with 'deep bruising' on her hands and abdomen, evidence of blunt-force trauma 'indicative of blows, and/or kicks, and possible strikes with blunt object.' An accompanying diagram illustrated long, thin bruises along Hernández Rodriguez’s back and sides, as well as extensive hemorrhaging on Hernández Rodriguez’s right and left wrists, which Dr. Sperry found were 'typical of handcuff injuries.'""

It has been repeatedly reported that asylum seekers at the border are held in freezing holding cells (often referred to as ""hieleras"") for days. Cibola is a facility for male inmates, which also suggests abusive behaviour by the authorities.

> ""Paired with the abuse we know transgender people regularly suffer in ICE detention, the death of Ms. Hernández sends the message that transgender people are disposable and do not deserve dignity, safety, or even life,"" said Isa Noyola, Deputy Director at Transgender Law Center.
> 
> ""It is alarming that transgender communities continue to face transphobic violence outside and inside of detention walls,"" says Flor Bermudez, Legal Director at Transgender Law Center. ""This is why TLC's Trans Immigrant Defense Effort (TIDE) has organized to demand the liberation of transgender women from detention and the end of all detention and deportations. ICE has shown time and again it is incapable of protecting transgender women in detention. Transgender people should not be detained by ICE, at all.""
> 
> ""We have been demanding the release of our trans communities detained in ICE detention centers because of rampant physical and brutal treatment from guards and other detainees,"" said Jorge Gutiérrez, Executive Director of Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement.
> 
> ""At a time when we are grieving the murders of transgender women of color, and the murder of 20 year-old Claudia Patricia Gómez Gonzalez by Border Patrol at the Texas-Mexico border, it is unconscionable that a transgender woman would die in the hands of ICE at the Cibola trans pod in immigration detention. The community, now more than ever, needs to organize to protect our most vulnerable, in particular transgender immigrant women who are surrounded by violence on a daily basis,"" added Anandrea Molina, President of Organización Latina de Trans en Texas.
> 
> Transgender immigrants often seek asylum, withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture because of violence, rape and torture they have experienced in their countries of origin due to their gender identity or expression. However, once inside the United States, transgender immigrants may often face similar risks, as well as criminalization, as they are targeted and harassed by police or held in detention where they experience violence, discrimination, and an inability to access to medical care, all of which may lead to dire consequences.

Subsequently it emerged that ICE had illegally deleted surveillance footage and other evidence.

> Phoenix (AZ) - The Transgender Law Center (TLC) organization filed a lawsuit on Wednesday for the alleged removal of a surveillance video and other evidence on the case of the undocumented transgender Roxsana Hernández Rodríguez , who died in ICE custody at a facility in New Mexico detention .
>
> The 33-year-old Honduran died nine days after being transferred to a unit dedicated to transgender women at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico, which is operated by CoreCivic, the country's second largest private prison company.
>
> Anna Castro, a spokesman for Transgender Law Center (TLC), told Efe that the lawsuit is against CoreCivic, ""and not only for the video, but for all the evidence that may have a connection with Roxsana during the time she remained in Cibola.""
>
> The organization and lawyers say that, by federal rule, ICE must preserve material that can serve as evidence, including electronic recordings.

> 28-year-old Black trans woman Marquiisha Lawrence of Greenville, South Carolina is the most recently reported victim of fatal violence terrorizing the trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming community in the United States. She died in her family home on Friday, November 5 where family members discovered her body at approximately 4:45 PM. Police reports indicate that she had multiple gunshot wounds. An autopsy was scheduled for the weekend.
>
> “Marquiisha Lawrence was found dead inside her residence located at 15 Loop Street in Greenville by family members. It appears that she was involved in an altercation with one or more individuals.”
>
> Marquiisha grew up in South Carolina where she graduated high school and studied cosmetology in nearby Spartanburg. She supported herself by working as a cook, a residential aid, and as a dancer. Marquiisha’s family held a balloon release for her on Sunday. Final arrangements are pending. As is the investigation.
>
> Marquiisha is the forty-fifth trans, nonbinary or gender nonconforming person reported killed in 2021. Forty of these neighbors have been BIPOC. 30 of these victims were under the age of 30. That we know of, as many deaths go unreported or unacknowledged. 2021 is now the most violent year on record for our trans neighbors in the United States, surpassing the previous total of 44 deaths in 2020.

Dacorey Dashawn Massey, 17, was subsequently charged with her murder.

Five officers - including the security commissioner of the Municipality of Casimiro Castillo - were arrested and charged with the crimes of enforced disappearance, abuse of authority and qualified homicide.

> 
> According to LGBT + organizations and local press, both the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Municipal Police made her transfeminicide invisible. Both institutions avoided reporting that the victim was a trans woman. They even used their deadname and referred to Britani with masculine pronouns.
> 
> The hate crime against Britani Jaqueline occurred after municipal police from Casimiro Castillo, Jalisco, arrested her for an alleged robbery. According to local media, Letra Fría, the municipal police did not fill out the detention protocol and beat Britani ""brutally"". Later, upon leaving the separations, the victim required urgent medical assistance. However, ""she could not be transferred"", and died as a result of the beatings.
> 
> The aforementioned media indicated that the Jalisco Prosecutor's Office has already linked five people - the security commissioner of the Municipality of Casimiro Castillo and four municipal policemen - to the process for the hate crime against Britani Jaqueline.

Hanar,28.0,2022-02-06,Kordestan,Islamic Republic of Iran,35.5168281,46.1608599,suicide,suicide,"Hanar died by suicide.

> MARIWAN, Iran - It was the early hours of February 6, when 28-year-old Sara, a transgender woman from the city of Mariwan in Iran’s western Kurdistan province called her friend Hanar to check up on her. Hanar’s brother answered the phone, telling Sara that Hanar had done what she had said she would do for a long time. She had taken her life. 
> 
> Screams filled the Mariwan graveyard the next morning as friends and family stood over the grave of Hanar, who was named [deadname] at birth, but decided to go by the name Hanar to better reflect the gender she identified as. It was also the nickname her friends, also transgender, referred to her as. 
> 
> Sara was the first of the friendship group to find out that Hanar had committed suicide earlier that morning. She wanted to check up on Hanar because she had already expressed her suicidal thoughts to Sara on several occasions. 
> 
> “She would always tell me about her pain, she did not like men’s clothes and did not want to act like a man, but we could not come out in public because the city is very small,” Sara told Rudaw English, crying over the death of her friend. “She wanted to undergo surgery, but when she asked a religious cleric last year, he told her that the surgery is forbidden in Sunni Islam, and she could not even tell her family about her problems.”
> 
> Sara was evidently shaken up as she recalled the amount of times Hanar had asked her to commit suicide together.  “She was talking about suicide more during the past few months. She told me ‘if you dare, let us commit suicide together and get out of this pain’, but nothing I told her seemed to have any effect,” Sara added.
> 
> At the end of their last encounter on February 5, Sara found it unusual how tightly Hanar had hugged her before leaving. “At around 3 am I gave her a call, but her brother picked up and said she had killed herself and her body was at the hospital,” she said, and just like that, another member of the LGBT+ community had fallen victim to the deeply entrenched cultural and traditional norms of Middle Eastern society. 
>
> Despite the Iranian government subsidizing sex reassignment surgeries for transgender people, endorsed by a decree from Iran’s former top Shiite religious authority Grand Ayatollah Khomeini, the process still requires the consent of the person’s family and the approval of specialized physicians.
> 
> The decree, however, is not implemented in the Sunni majority areas, mainly located in the predominantly Kurdish-populated western part of the country. As opposed to the cosmopolitan cities of Iran, the transgender community in Kurdish cities confronts a very difficult reality. Many either conceal their true gender identities, or attempt to migrate to more accepting countries where their rights are guaranteed.

In April 2016 James Dixon, 25, was sentenced to 12 years on charges of second-degree manslaughter and first-degree assault.

> While Ms. Nettles was still in a coma, Mr. Dixon turned himself in to the police. In written and videotaped statements, he told detectives that he had started flirting with Ms. Nettles, unaware she was transgender, after meeting her and her two friends on the street. He said he became enraged and attacked her when his friends began mocking him for trying to pick up a transgender woman. “I just didn’t want to be fooled,” he said in a videotaped statement.
>
> The victim’s mother, Delores Nettles, told the court she believed 12 years was too light a sentence, given the brutal beating her daughter took. “He can go home after those 12 years and see his family,” she said in tears. “It’s not fair.” Turning to Mr. Dixon, she said: “How can you sleep at night? How can you rest? I can’t rest.”
>
> Mr. Dixon showed no emotion. He declined to make a statement before Justice Daniel P. Conviser pronounced the sentence, which had been negotiated with the judge on the eve of the trial in return for a guilty plea. Prosecutors objected to the deal; they had sought a sentence of at least 17 years.

Now and then the family referred to her by her birth name, or as many in the trans community call it, her dead name. Deadnaming is the act of referring to a trans person by their birth name instead of their chosen name. Some of the family members also had an issue using Crystal's preferred pronouns. However, they spoke highly and honestly of her. You could see how fresh this trauma was on all of the family's faces. Any time Crystal's sister spoke of her, she would fight back tears.

> This week started in a mood of mourning for the LGBTI community in Curitiba. Isabella Soares, 22 years old, was murdered in the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, in a crime that seems to have been aimed at her companion. Isabella has lived in Canoas since the beginning of the year and may have been killed by mistake.
> 
> According to the police, the man who was in the room with her was the target of a  gang of three men who broke into the San Diego motel in the Ipanema neighborhood and ordered that the door be opened. When this did not happen they fired several shots with a 9mm pistol through a window, hitting Isabella three times. She died on the spot. The crime occurred at around 11 pm on Sunday.
> 
> The 24-year-old who was with her has a criminal record. He hid in the bathroom and was the one who called the Military Brigade after the criminals left the place. The 4th Homicide Police Station in Porto Alegre (4th DPHPP) of the Civil Police investigates the murder. Apparently, in a brief internet search, executions inside motels in Rio Grande do Sul are common.
> 
> It is worth praising the police of Rio Grande do Sul and the Rio Grande do Sul press that did not treat the death of the young trans in a sensationalist way, always referring to her as a woman, without revealing her transsexuality.

Josie Berrios (aka Kendra Adams and Kimbella Rosé),28.0,2017-06-13,New York,United States of America,42.422372,-76.461572,violence,burned,"Josie’s burnt body was discovered inside a building at a construction site next to a can of petrol. Evidence, including surveillance video, led police to her boyfriend Michael Davis, 45.

In 2018 Davis pleaded guilty to charges of second degree murder.

> On the day they buried Josie, those who loved her best bathed her casket in a cascade of color.
>
> They huddled together, dozens of her closest family and friends, wearing ponchos against the heavy rain, and tossed handfuls of multi-colored sugar on the wooden box. The colors swirled atop the water-slicked casket as family and friends traced hearts and messages in the residue.
> 
> A friend played the ukulele and sang ""Over the Rainbow."" The crowd joined in, singing young Dorothy Gale's song about longing for a happier place, about yearning in the face of reality.
> 
> In a word, Josie's mother said, it was beautiful.
> 
> No one word could describe the 28-year-old woman they buried that day in Greensprings Natural Cemetery, near Josie's home of Ithaca. Beautiful — certainly, in spirit most of all, those who knew Josie Berrios say. She was generous, compassionate, colorful, bigger-than-life. That casket? Josie's mother Judy said they wanted it ""decked out like the diva she was."" 
> 
> Josie, they say, exuded light — a light extinguished by her murder June 13, 2017, at the hands of her boyfriend, Michael Davis. The man and their volatile relationship had unnerved Josie's family, and the violence she suffered at his hands is horrifyingly familiar: More than half — 55%, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — of all female homicide victims in the United States are killed by an intimate partner.

Josie performed as a drag queen under the name Kimbella Rosé as part of the House of Merlot, a wine-themed drag house. Her stage name was as Kimbella Rosé.

> Though Josie was a woman, not a man dressing as a woman as many other performers were, performing gave her an opportunity to step outside the typical dress code of everyday life. On stage she could be bold, putting on extra makeup and dressing up in fun costumes.
> 
> She had solid plans, detailed dreams: to legally change her name to Kendra Adams and get her driver's license, then to apply for cosmetology school and become a licensed professional.
> 
> Something always seemed to get in the way. 
> 
> She had no transportation to the Rochester cosmetology school, she fell behind in the paperwork, and there were constantly more immediate needs for the money she and Judy had set aside.
>
> ""(Transgender people) need opportunities,"" Maurer said, ""and in my mind, those opportunities are things many transgender people face barriers to: public employment, education, easy ability to obtain identity documents. It's not because of you and your identity; it's because of the conditions around you.""

Dilan Vera Parra,26.0,2014-12-29,Santiago Metropolitan,Chile,-33.591103,-70.636587,violence,burnt and stabbed,"Dilan died after being stabbed in the chest. According to her mother several hours earlier the same people had sprayed a liquid on her daughter's face and tried to burn her.

> The social acceptance of Dilan, as a woman, was reduced to a Facebook profile with the pseudonym Yeimi Andrea. There she organized her outings and also received sexual proposals for money, which came in piles. There she also discharged her sorrows of love. ""The one who made her suffer the most was a good macho man,"" says Paula, a robust woman, one of the aunts-neighbors who knew her the most.
> 
> On that same Facebook, Dilan moved away from the life she created for others, which she hid as he said ""out of respect for her brother and his mother."" Her true identity comes to life in the photos. Yeimi Andrea is extroverted, sexy and appears with a tiny purple mesh dress that reveals pieces of white skin. Curly hair set aside, long eyelashes and red mouth give life to Yeimi. There are dozens of comments in each post, all are from men, who praise and declare, has more than two thousand followers.
> 
> Dilan studied nursing at OTEC José Obrero and finished her practice with grade seven. Last year she worked in a nursing home and since then she was dedicated to the sporadic care of some elderly people in the upper neighborhood. She had to leave her previous job as a result of the constant harassment of a boss and his coworkers. Before, she only had occasional jobs as a guard in a supermarket and a clothing salesman in a mall. As a guard she had to ""dress up"" as a man to ""fit in"", explained his mother.
>
> ""If she did not hide who she was, she could not get a job. She suffered there, she had to cut her hair"", recalls Elvira.

In February 2015 María Inés Norambuena Parra, 52, was arrested in San Antonio for her murder. Allegedly she stabbed Dilan after learning that her partner had had sexual relations with the Dilan. Norambuena reportedly had a police record that included records of theft, violation of the Drug Law, infraction of the Weapons Law, robbery with intimidation, robbery with violence and homicide.

He was then sentenced to 9 years, for sexual harassment and robbery against a trans [person[ from Bisceglie. However, he was freed again at the beginning of November 2018 after the Court of Appeal had acquitted him.
>
> More recently, Lomolino was the subject of two precautionary custody orders as part of the Medusa operation against a mafia-type criminal association called ""Clan Corda-Lomolino"".

> We received the news of the death of Ares Saturno and Soren Neres Denardi and we spent a few hours waiting for someone to tell us that it was just a mess and nothing had happened. That the two people were still alive. But no ... And it is with great sorrow that we write these lines that follow.
> 
> The non-binary trans couple was living in Praia Grande, São Paulo coast, with plans to move to Ceará. Apparently there was no time. Both committed suicide in a hotel in the city of Ribeirão Pires.
> 
> Ares Saturno , a former Brazilian who chose to be from São Paulo, worked writing for Canaltech Brasil and was a declared lover of corporal modifications. Soren Neres Denardi had just turned 31, was a student of Letters of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro - UFRJ and fought bravely in the institution so that the trans people were entitled to use the social name. The life expectancy of a trans person in Brazil is 35 years, half when we compare with the cis population.
> 
> Friends, friends and friends of the couple claim that it was suicide, both had history and, it seems, combined everything. In one of the messages shared on social networks, Soren says goodbye to a friend and says they are going to the next phase, "" and it's not in an organic body . "" In those words, they said they were satisfied with themselves, but tired and that the world of humans is unjust. Soren also complained on the social networks of their critical financial situation and asked for help.
> 
> The death of Ares and Soren is a tragedy echoed in everyday transphobia and hatred of the different. Happening exactly in the Trans Visibility Month  is symptomatic and should teach us something. It is a great warning for us to do something - as long as there is time - for dissenting people to have a desire and a right to live. Our country has become a (more) suffocating and (more) unbearable place for trans people in its broadest spectrum of gender diversity. It is a painful alert, but it is once again being rubbed in the face of society with its system of necropoly. It is urgent that something is done.
> 
> May Ares and Soren rest in peace. Our condolences to friends, friends and friends of both. We are very sorry.

Drobik tells us “They found the home in disarray suggesting to the police that Carrell and Zakaria could be in danger, by Jan 30th we were sure that we were looking at a body retrieval rather than a missing person. A missing person report was filled but authorities and family members feared the worst.”

I learned of the information yesterday and have checked in with some of the trans women who knew her directly. While she is still being misgendered and misidentified by most KC media outlets, community advocates have already begun to share updates as we learn more. I encourage agencies with social, political and financial power to do something about this.” Trans woman Brooklyn Lindsey was murdered across the state line in Kansas City, Mo., in June.

Subsequently relatives stated that Jamar was a gender nonconforming gay man rather than a trans woman. We obviously can't ask Ja'leyah, but it is not unusual for friends and family to have different perceptions of the gender of an individual.

"Hilary Medina (""Cristin"")",22.0,2020-01-18,Huila,Colombia,2.9243817,-75.2930971,violence,shot,"Hilary was one of two people shot by two men on a motorcycle on the evening of Saturday 18th January. Her colleague survived but Hilary died in hospital.

> At almost 10:00 pm on last Saturday January 18, Hilary Medina, a 22-year-old trans woman, was with another young woman from the LGBTI community on the corner of a drugstore located [at the intersection of carrera 2 with calle 6] in the center of the city of Neiva (Huila).
>
> Everything seemed calm until two subjects who were riding a motorcycle arrived at the scene and one of them, without a word, fired indiscriminately against the two women.
>
> The young women tried to run to save their life. Hilary dodged some bullets, ran a few meters and then collapsed. According to the authorities, she received two impacts in her back.
>
> The brutal attack was captured by security cameras in the area. Her partner, meanwhile, was injured in the shoulder and is currently recovering in hospital.

Hilary had transitioned 5 years earlier and had a good relationship with her mother Claudia. Like far too many other trans women in Latin America, she had been forced into making a living as a sex worker.

> ""The discrimination we suffered was great. My daughter had a job of prostitution because she could never go to a school where she was received as the woman she felt herself to be. She could never access a decent job where they respected her [identity]. That's why many from them they choose that path, not because they want to, but because it is their turn; because there are no opportunities of any kind,"" Claudia said.
>
> “The day she left, I told her daughter very carefully; because you really know that they are exposed to many things on the street and more in that trade. It is difficult for a mother to know that her daughter was murdered without knowing why, I do not really understand what happened, ”said her mother as tears moisten her face.
>
> “My daughter's dream was to celebrate my birthday and buy me a house so I wouldn't continue paying rent. I just want to tell you something, never forget that transsexual, gay, lesbian or whatever people, are daughters, sisters, granddaughters because they have a family, and today it hurts us what they did to my daughter, because it was I who I had in my gut and I never cared what her sexual condition was, so I accepted it, ”concludes Claudia Jaramillo.

> Bianca, dear editorial of the Gelderlander, was a woman who had probably been victim of her entire life for people who did not take it as full?—?not as a woman and not as a person. Bianca was not a man who looked utterly like a woman, she was a woman, perhaps more aware of her femininity than most women ever will be, and paid the highest possible price with her death. What she has between her legs does not appeal to a reader. This makes the editors guilty of sexual objectification.
> 
> The reason why so many female trans persons work in prostitution is equally painful: they are not accepted for any other profession. Not even in the Netherlands. Transgender people do not have the greatest arrears and the weakest financial position of all groups in our society for good reason. Imaging is thereby all-determining. And let the media now constantly miss the shelf.

Dymun Dupree,28.0,2019-09-27,Georgia,United States of America,32.6874929,-83.6241915,violence,shot,"Dymun went missing on 2nd April 2016. A human skull was found with gunshot wounds on 12th May 2016, but was not identified by DNA testing as hers until September 2019.

Her date of death and the identity of her killer (or killers) are unknown.

Dymun was obviously not included on the TDoR 2016 memorial list released in November 2016 by Transgender Europe (TGEU). The date of her identification is used for this report in order that she might be remembered at TDoR 2019 this November.

> ""After more than three years, DNA confirmed the human remains from 2016 Macon homicide case are that of a transgender woman. DNA test results recently obtained by the Bibb County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the match.
>
> ""Bibb County Coroner Leon Jones told The Telegraph on Friday the remains are Dymun Dupree, originally identified by Warner Robins police as [deadname].
>
> ""Dupree had been missing for two weeks on April 18, 2016, when the Warner Robins Police Department sent out a news release asking for the public’s help finding her. ""The 26-year-old was last seen leaving home, on the north side of Warner Robins, just before midnight April 2. Four days later, Victoria Clark reported her cousin missing. She told police Dupree said she was going to hang out with friends but did not say where or with whom.
>
> ""On May 12, more than a month later, a man mowing grass at a vacant lot on Feagin Road, off Ga. 247, made a gruesome discovery. Amid the kudzu, briers and overgrowth, he found a human skull and called 911. ""At the time, the sheriff’s department could only say that a person had been shot in the head. The sex and race of the victim were not apparent.

> Investigators visited Dupree’s mother, Frankie Allen, and took a cheek swab so that her DNA could be compared to the victim’s remains. In January 2017, DNA from the remains was sent to the Center for Human Identification at the University of North Texas. There, forensic scientists developed a DNA profile and compared it with DNA from Allen that was obtained using the swab.
> 
> “It’s just hard when you don’t know what to think,” Allen told The Telegraph in a May 2018 interview. The last time Allen saw Dupree, she was sitting on her porch reading the mail. The two told each other, “I love you.”
>
> Dupree enjoyed singing gospel music, her mom said. She ate cookies with milk daily, enjoyed drinking Coca-Cola Classic and smoking Newports in the morning.

Miraş Güneş,36.0,2021-03-11,Izmir,Turkey,38.438388,27.1952953,violence,beaten,"Miraş was found wrapped in a blanket on a sofa bed in her home. Investigators determined that she died from blunt force trauma to the head.

> It has emerged that a transgender person, whose body was found wrapped in a blanket in the Bornova district of Izmir, was killed as a result of being hit around the head by a hard object.
> 
> When bad smells began to emanate from the apartment of the transgender person who used the name 'Miras Günes', the residents of the building reported the situation to her relatives. She had not been heard from for a while and her relatives had reported her missing.

Three suspects were subsequently arrested. In November 2021, Serdar Gülsoy was sentenced to life imprisonment (with a minimum term of 18 years) but the other two suspects were released.

> In the examination made by the police teams who came, it was determined that [deadname] had been hit on the head with a hard object and his face had become unrecognizable. Serdar Gülsoy (43), Turgay Türker (37) and Murat Inceçelik (29), who were arrested in connection with the incident.
>
> In the indictment prepared after the investigation, the prosecutor sentenced Serdar Gülsoy to life imprisonment and 18 years in prison on charges of 'deliberate murder', 'qualified theft', 'violation of the immunity of more than one residence at night' and 'chain abuse of another's bank or credit card'. and Murat Inceçelik on charges of 'deliberately assisting murder', 'qualified theft', 'violation of the immunity of more than one residence at night' and 'chain abuse of someone else's bank or credit card'. The indictment was accepted by the Izmir 5th High Criminal Court.
>
> The defendant Turgay Türker argued that Serdar Gülsoy threatened him. Türker said, ""When I was upstairs, when Serdar came, I went downstairs and saw the victim lying on the floor. Serdar said that if I told someone else about the incident, he would tell us that we had realized the incident together. He threatened me with my family. From that moment on, I did what the accused Serdar said."" said. The accused Murat Inceçelik also did not accept the accusations against him.
>
> The court decided to release Murat Inceçelik and Turgay Türker on condition of judicial control by applying a ban on leaving the country, and to continue the detention of Serdar Gülsoy. The delegation adjourned the hearing by ruling that the witnesses should be heard and the camera recording device in the house where the incident took place should be sent to the court for expert examination.

It is possible that her death was accidental as her body did not show traces of violence - however the lack of evidence of the bike coming off the road suggested otherwise. A post-mortem exaimation may  reveal more.

A day earlier [Márcia Marcita](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2021/04/09/marcia-marcita_ribeirao-preto-sao-paulo-brazil_5e3c9431) had been found murdered in the same city. A link between the two killings has not been ruled out.

> The Military Police (PM) found the body of the [trans woman] Milena Massafera, on Saturday night (10), with several marks of stab wounds in a kitchenette located on Rua Coronel Luiz da Cunha, in Vila Tibério, in the west of Ribeirão Preto. This is the second case of [a trans woman] killed during programs this week alone, and the police are working on the possibility that there is a link between the deaths.
> 
> The president of the Arco Íris NGO in Ribeirão Preto, Fábio de Jesus, is calling for a broad investigation by the Civil Police in the deaths of the two [trans women], as he believes that there is a connection between the two cases. “The two [trans women] were killed with great violence. Marks all over the body, including the feet, which indicates a hate action designed to murder [trans women]. As LGBT, I also fear for my life. This cannot continue,” he said.
> 
> According to the PM, family members of the victim, whose civil name is [deadname] da Silva Vieira, called the police after finding her body in the apartment where she lived. 
> 
> According to the family, Milena's friends had called to say they were unable to speak to the [trans woman]. The family went to the place and with the help of a private locksmith they managed to gain access to the property and locate the victim who was on the floor covered in blood. The Mobile Emergency Care Service (Samu) was called and the death was confirmed at the scene. 
> 
> This is the second case of death of [a trans woman] in less than 24 hours. The first was identified on the morning of last Friday (9th), at the Avelino Alves Palma Industrial Park, in the northern area of Ribeirão Preto. The victim was [Márcia Marcita](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2021/04/09/marcia-marcita_ribeirao-preto-sao-paulo-brazil_5e3c9431), 48, whose body was found in her apartment  with signs of violence by a friend. The cause of death was not identified and the case is still being investigated by the Civil Police.

> 
> Arelis Cabezas Sierra , a 38-year-old woman, died hours after a procedure around 4:00 pm last Thursday, January 20 of this year. "" She was my best friend, my little sister. I studied college with her, we watched class with her, we told each other everything, she was a very intelligent person, you could talk to her about anything, any topic."" said Daniel, Arelis's brother.
> 
> Arelis' relatives are demanding that the cause of death be investigated , as they maintain that there was negligence. ""I think there was a very obvious negligence here , because they did not have the medical teams available for resuscitation and there were no medical staff in charge with any authority. What's more, if the surgeon and the friend were there in the room, the one who should be resuscitating is the surgeon."", said Daniel.
> 
> According to the news outlet Noticias Caracol, he contacted the surgeon Yesid ""M"", who performed the procedure on the trans woman. The doctor assured that it was a planned and scheduled surgery within everything normal, and that all of the pertinent laboratory tests required to be able to operate on a patient had been performed.
> 
> The surgeon mentioned that the plastic surgery was performed under the proper protocols and explained that he is attentive to do what the justice determines and awaits the opinion of Legal Medicine.
> 
> However, the district entity affirmed that an administrative process had been initiated against the doctor and the surgery room had been closed. In addition to this, flaws were found in the infrastructure and staffing of the clinic. The opinion of Legal Medicine will be decisive in determining the cause of death of Arelis.

X had been bullied relentlessly by his peers, which played a factor in his death, however, the school has not recognised this as the result of bullying on their premises, and have outwardly tried to silence any and all claims of this.""

> El Centro Psico Trans de Quito and Asociación Silueta X, members of Plataforma Nacional Revolución Trans and the Federación ecuatoriana de Organizaciones LGBT, make the following public knowledge:
> 
> This December 28, 2020, HJ Ramírez, better known as La Tigra, was found dead at the gate of her house, located in Lomas de la Florida II, Guayaquil. La Tigra as they affectionately called her, 46 years old, was dedicated to the craft of sewing in the sector and was known for her kindness, cordiality and good heart by the locals.
> 
> Early this Monday, HJ Ramírez received a visit from an individual at her home at approximately 01:00 am. According to footage from the security cameras of a local neighbor, the subject was there close to an hour before running desperately out of La Tigra's home. In the morning, a client who was going to pick up her sewing found her lying down and lifeless near the door. Her body was stiff and bruised, and according to criminology data from the autopsy performed, HJ Ramírez died of asphyxiation - presumably by the individual who visited her and then rushed out of her home. The National Police continues in investigations.
> 
> We call on the authorities, especially the State Attorney General's Office and the National Police, to investigate the present case, regardless of whether or not the complaint is filed by the next of kin. Although it is true, it is known that, in the face of violent deaths, not clarified or suspected of criminality, the complaint is ex officio by the Prosecutor's Office, members of the Police, they mentioned that without a complaint there would be no investigations. This was reported to us by neighbors in the sector. Likewise, we invite the new Ministry of Government to provide us with answers about this and other murders, violent deaths, not clarified or suspected of criminality. Likewise, we request the Ombudsman's Office to monitor the due process initiated by the Prosecutor's Office.

Alexander Blake VanDalsen,21.0,2021-02-09,Indiana,United States of America,40.3935819,-86.9070575,suicide,possible suicide,"Alexander was found dead after being missing for a week.

> The missing person for whom police were searching the past week has reportedly died, the Tippecanoe County Coroner's office confirmed after identifying a corpse found in Lafayette Tuesday afternoon.
> 
> Lafayette man Alex VanDalsen, 21, was deceased when found by police on the 2000-block of Breckenridge Street in Lafayette around 1 p.m. Tuesday, according to Lafayette Police Department logs.
> 
> Pride Lafayette, a group that advocates for LGBTQ people in Greater Lafayette, started a Facebook fundraiser in an effort to raise money for VanDalsen's funeral expenses on Wednesday. VanDalsen was a transgender man, according to his Facebook page.
> 
> The petition, which as of Wednesday evening had raised over $3,200 from nearly 100 people, can be found on Facebook on a page titled ""Alexander's Funeral Expenses.""
> 
> ""We did not know Alex, but we do know that no mother should ever have to bury a child,"" wrote Ashley Smith, the fundraiser's creator. ""He was someone's child, someone's sibling, someone's grandchild.""
> 
> Police have not said whether VanDalsen was found with any injuries. An autopsy is scheduled for Thursday, according to the coroner.


Subsequently his death was ruled a suicide following an autopsy. However, his family dispute the verdict:

> On February 3, 2021, It was a cold Indiana evening with snow on the ground. Alex left home on foot before midnight without telling anyone where he was going. 
>
> He wouldn't be seen alive again. On February 9th, Alex was found dead. His death was ruled a suicide without any investigation. The family doesn't believe the suicide theory for the following reasons:
>
> Alex's hands weren't tested for gunpowder residue.
>
> The gun was found underneath his body and wasn't tested for fingerprints. 
>
> Alex was found 10 miles from his home. It was less than 20 degrees and he wasn't dressed for the weather. He also didn't take his car. So how did he get to the site where his body was found? Because of his asthma, the snow and low temperature, he didn't make the 10 mile walk. 
>
> There were no shell casings at the death scene. How was that possible? 
>
> There was no blood splatter at the scene.
>
> Jennifer VanDalsen (Alex's mother) believes someone picked Alex up, killed him and then dumped his body. However, she believes law enforcement refused to investigate the case seriously because Alex was transgender. 
>
> The family has asked law enforcement to answer their concerns about Alex's death. They haven't received any answers. Did Alex truly commit suicide or was he murdered?

Mickerlange François,28.0,2020-10-17,Ouest,Haiti,18.5128958,-72.2918008,violence,shot,"Mickerlange was shot inside a nightclub on the night of Saturday 17th October. He was a police officer, and his assailant allegedly knew that he was a trans man.

> Mickerlange François, a transgender policeman was shot dead in Pétion-Ville, in a nightclub on the evening of Saturday, October 17. Two days later police apprehended Obenson Saindor, 28, aboard a motorcycle while trying to get to Dame-Marie, Grand’Anse on the coast.
> 
> Due to the public and media apathy, and the prevalence of transphobia in society and Haitian law enforcement, we are just now learning about the murder of Officer François.
> 
> After the policeman’s death, investigators focused on the community and barraged LGBT+ Haitians with excessive questions about the victim, according to Midou Blonski (pseudonym), a leader of the Haitian advocacy group FACSDIS (Femme en Action contre la Stigmatisation et la Discrimination Sexuelle/Women Taking Action Against Sexual Stigmatization and Discrimination).

According to the advocacy journalist Moïse Manoel, the motive may have been jealousy:

> The alleged murderer, 28-year-old Obenson Saindor, shot policeman Mickerlange François in a Pétionville nightclub on Oct. 17.
> 
> Passion and jealousy were motives, as the victim had engaged in a romantic relationship with the alleged murderer’s partner. The alleged murderer had already threatened Mickerlange’s life while telling him to stay away from his household. Unfortunately, the victim did not take these threats seriously.
> 
> The alleged murderer was apprehended with the victim’s police service weapon, a 9mm caliber revolver.  Obenson was also in possession of a second revolver, which investigators said could have been used to commit the crime.
> 
> The alleged murderer knew the policeman was a trans man. The fact that Mickerlange died because of his gender identity disgusts me.
> 
> In addition, for me, this affair illustrates the way women are treated in Haiti. They are not respected and are seen as objects. Consequently, one can kill a rival, even a trans man, as one pleases. Women are seen as property, for one’s exclusive benefit.
> 
> This homicide illustrates anew the negation of feminine desire and aspirations. Because she loved someone else, he must be killed—without reflecting on what isn’t working between the original couple. That’s the problem.
> 
> We remain in a patriarchal society where women’s desires are ignored. This mentality leads only to submission or death.

> 
> “We will miss the way she went from no-nonsense organising with an iron will to being incredibly compassionate and looking after people who were struggling with abuse and harassment. There's no one way to describe her, except to say it has been a privilege to know her, and we miss her.”

Kimbella Kimble,21.0,2022-08-06,Mississippi,United States of America,30.4391082,-89.0569243,custodial,died in custody,"Kimbella died in police custody at Harrison County Adult Detention Center. A video shows her being tasered by corrections officers despite her struggling to breathe.

> Kimbella Kimble, a Black trans woman just 21 years of age, died in police custody in the Harrison County Adult Detention Center approximately 24 hours after being placed in solitary confinement. A video of the incident posted to social media shows Kimbella being tased by corrections officers, while saying “I can’t breathe.” Transgender people are disproportionately likely to be incarcerated, and once there, they face much higher levels of mistreatment and violence - including a higher likelihood of being placed in solitary confinement. HRC extends its deepest condolences to Kimbella’s friends and family.

Atlanta police said there were no signs of foul play, but people who knew her claim that she was killed during an argument.

> Friends and transgender advocates said Bonaire “Bonnie” Black was trying to find employment and housing. She was found dead on Dec. 31.
> 
> With fistfuls of pink and blue balloons – the colors of the transgender flag – friends gathered outside a drop-in center last week to memorialize Bonaire “Bonnie” Black, a transgender teen living on the streets who was found dead on New Year’s Eve.
> 
> The death of Black, 19, is under investigation by the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s office. There were no signs of foul play, according to an incident report from Atlanta police, but people who knew Black said she was killed during an argument.
> 
> Black was at least the fifth trans or gender non-conforming person to be killed or die under questionable circumstances in Georgia in 2020.
> 
> The body of Black, 19, was found on the third floor of the parking garage at the Georgian Terrace on Peachtree Street in Midtown, according to an incident report. An employee found her laying under a blanket with her fist clenched at about 2:30 p.m. on Dec. 31.
> 
> When a hotel manager and another employee couldn’t wake Black, they called police. A police report described the incident as a “natural death.” Officer Sharetia Thomas, the police officer who responded to the hotel’s call, wrote in an incident report that an employee of the medical examiner called to the scene “advised me there was no foul play.”
> 
> An investigator with the medical examiner’s office told Project Q Atlanta that an autopsy was performed but declined to discuss details of the investigation. It could be six weeks before a lab returns toxicology test results to the medical examiner’s office. 

Bonnie died just 7 days before her 19th birthday and was homeless at the time of her death. She was described by those who knew her as an artist, songwriter and rapper.

> “She loved doing her makeup and going out into the world making sure she looked her best,” Toni Bryce, a community health outreach worker with the National AIDS Education & Services for Minorities (NAESM), said during the event. “She was a young girl taken very soon,” she added.
> 
> Black was a client at Da Cribb, which NAESM operates, for more than two years, Bryce told Project Q. Staff at the facility last saw her on or about Dec. 28, she added.
> 
> Black was living on the streets at the time of her death and would sometimes sleep on Da Cribb’s porch, Bryce said.
> 
> “Every day we were open, she would come in and utilize the services we had,” she added.
> 
> Black was from Savannah and relocated to Atlanta at 17, according to trans activists. Bryce said she was trying to find a job and housing. But even facing difficult circumstances, Black still tried to help others in need.
> 
> “When she was trying to find housing, she was trying to help people. She was definitely always trying to help somebody else that was in her situation,” Bryce said.

> **In Memory of Sherrell Faulkner**
> 
> This is a memorial for Sherrell Faulkner, a 46-year old woman from Charlotte, North Carolina, who deserves to be remembered as fully human, and not merely as a headline. It goes almost without saying that Ms. Faulkner’s death is one in a tragic continuum of black trans women who are victimized, brutalized, and murdered just for their very existence. It needs to be said, however, that Sherrell Faulkner’s life is worth specific recognition and celebration. In every way that her death is systematic, it is also deeply individual, and should be treated as such.  
> 
> When we only see Sherrell Faulkner as one name in a much-too-long list of transgender victims, we dehumanize her in a means that is ideologically similar to her aggressor(s). For this reason, we won’t to re-iterate the specifics of her death, since too many pieces focus only on them (we have linked some of these throughout.) Instead, we want to take a moment to talk about the Southern context of her death, and most importantly, the specifics of her life, which deserves its own context and recognition. Her death is both part of a national epidemic and a Charlotte-specific tragedy; it is simultaneously a community-wide trial and an individual tribulation for her loved ones.

She was found ""naked, stabbed, with a bleeding wound in the chest"".

> 7 to 8 men attacked her. This follows other previous attacks. It would probably be a gang of men who regularly assault sex workers and their clients to steal from them. This band phenomenon targeting female sex workers is currently developing throughout the Ile de France region. Those who try to organize themselves to defend themselves and chase them are then attacked separately.
> 
> Today we mourn this loss and feel as usual abandoned. The murders of trans women sex workers are not rare. This is a recurring phenomenon and we regularly try to alert public opinion and the authorities to this violence. Unfortunately as always, we find ourselves alone.
> 
> Why does the life of trans women migrant sex workers matter so little? Why are our deaths treated only as news? Why are journalists so ignorant or so disrespectful that they say ""a transvestite prostitute"" is dead and continue to begrudge me into death? Does not the life of a bitch count?
> 
> We have in us this strange impression that our dead do not arouse any emotion. For us, there is never national mourning. There is never an official commemoration. The political class remains silent. Once the sensationalist press articles are over, it's the return to silence, and we have to go back to work with fear, waiting to be next.

Nine individuals were subsequently arrested in connection with her death. In January 2022 Mahmoud Kadri, 24, Karim Ibrahim, 29 and Aymen Dib, 25, went on trial for murder.

> Vanesa Campos, a 36-year-old trans [sex worker] was shot in the chest on the night of August 16-17, 2018 in the Boulogne forest, a place that is known for the presence of sex workers.
>
> To protect herself from the vandals, Vanesa Campos had hired a bodyguard. However this was not sufficient a measure against this gang since they arrived armed with tear gas canisters, a knife and an electric pistol.
>
> Days before, a firearm had been stolen from a policeman's vehicle while en he was with another sex worker and would be used to commit the crime.
>
> One of the shots fired fatally wounded Vanesa Campos. The prosecution considers Mahmoud Kadri, 24, to be the author of the fatal shot. Karim Ibrahim, 29, and Aymen Dib, 25, are also charged with participating; hitting and stabbing her, respectively.

In late January 2022 Mahmoud Kadri and Karim Ibrahim were sentenced to 22 years in prison for her murder. Six other defendents were sentenced to between 3 and 6 years.

> French justice sentenced two Egyptians to 22 years in prison this Saturday for the 2018 death of Vanesa Campos, a trans-Peruvian sex worker, on the outskirts of Paris.
>
> The sentences pronounced by the Paris criminal chamber against Mahmoud Kadri and Karim Ibrahim , for ""homicide in an organized gang"", are higher than those requested by the prosecution, of 20 and 15 years. Six other defendants for the same act were sentenced to three to six years in prison.

F. Domingues Rosa,36.0,2013-04-29,Rio de Janeiro,Brazil,-22.15327,-42.9247,violence,stabbed,"F. was found dead on her bed by neighbours. She had been stabbed 3 times.

> A [trans woman] was found dead in her house yesterday afternoon in the Bela Vista 2 neighborhood of Rio Preto. The body of [deadname] Domingues Rosa, 36, was found by neighbors who called the military police. According to investigators the body was on the bed and had three knife wounds: the left eye, the right side of the neck and also the right shoulder. Police suspect it may be a crime of passion. “Nothing was taken from the victim's house. It could have been some boyfriend disagreement,” said Police Officer Mauro Truzzi. 

Housewife Eliana Cristina Ferreira da Silva, 29, said another neighbor commented that she heard a cry for help on Sunday night. “He couldn't tell what time it was. Around noon (yesterday) I went with my neighbor Marissa to her house and we found everything overturned, a lot of blood and she was dead. ” 

In August 2018 Daniel da Silva Dellamora, 25, was convicted of her murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Jasmine Sierra,52.0,2016-01-22,California,United States of America,35.373405,-119.018911,violence,beaten,"Jasmine's body was found by police on 22nd January in an apartment on the 1000 block of Monterey Street.

Her body showed signs of trauma and foul play is suspected. Whether the police found the body in Sierra's home or a neighbour's house is not known.

Her friends said they had no idea she was killed until weeks later because her birth name was published in the media.
 
> With details scant about Sierra’s death, transgender advocates like Jeriann Guzman, the executive director of the Solano Serenity Center and Kelli Busey, editor-in-chief of Planet Transgender have sought to humanize Sierra and draw awareness about her death. The Solano Serenity Center was among the first to list Sierra on its website among trans homicide victims who must be remembered this year.
> 
> “Piecing together her life like a crossword puzzle we are learning a little about her,’” says Busey in her Planet Transgender report. ""There’s a Tumblr post where the author postulates a police conspiracy to cover up her murder which local media conspicuously called ‘suspicious.'""
> 
> The Tumblr post to which Busey refers alleges mishandling of the investigation by local police. While the author of the post remains unnamed, the individual’s allegations were repeated at the same time as the Tumblr post went live by two other trans people on Facebook (in comments now marked private) by individuals who claim to be friends of Sierra. (The author of the Tumblr post has not responded to a query by press time.)
> 
> The accusations on Tumblr and Facebook have yet to be verified because, for over a month, advocates say that Bakersfield police have not responded to queries. Advocates also note that the police’s apparent refusal to clarify the circumstances of the alleged homicide have exacerbated the transgender community’s frustration and fomented rampant speculation.

She had been was on her way to a party dressed in a white sleeveless vest and a short green and black skirtt, when she was attacked by two men who stabbed her to death. Belizean LGBT NGO UNIBAM called the murder a hate crime. It was reported that she had been harassed and received death threats before in the days leading to her murder.

> Police have evidence which says that Sanchez - dressed in full drag - was seen walking up and down on Elston Kerr Street near the Lord's Ridge Cemetery after 1:00 am. The evidence says that two men on bicycles rode up and are tried to rob Sanchez. [She] put up a fight, and in the scuffle one of them stabbed [her] in the chest. Sanchez ran and collapsed a short distance away.

Media reports variously describe J. as a gay man who crossdressed and a ""teenager who identified with a transgender orientation"". We will probably never know their true gender identity, but female pronouns are used above for consistancy with their presentation at the time they died.

> Tragedy in the night between Friday and Saturday, around 4am, on the A4. A 37-year-old Peruvian [trans woman] was mortally wounded by a car on the road towards Venice between the Verona Sud and Verona Est tollbooths, on the fast lane.
>
> The dynamics of the accident is still being examined by the Traffic Police, who intervened on the spot. Also present were the 118 health workers, who intervened with an ambulance, who could only ascertain the death.
>
> The [trans woman], in all probability [a sex worker], died as a result of a serious skull injury: she did not have [identity] documents with her. It is still unclear whether the victim crossed the highway on foot or whether she was dropped off by a car. The driver of the car which hit the trans [woman], did not stop at the scene.

The police identifed the driver who allegedly killed her, a Swiss driver who said he didn't realise he had hit a person and therefore hadn't stopped to ask for help.

If or why Marisol attempted to cross the highway or how she got there remains a mystery. The police are not ruling out the possibility that her body might have been dumped on the road already dead or injured by a third party or that she might have been fleeing from someone who was threatening her and had possibly driven her there.

Italy is one of the countries with the highest number of trans women killed in Europe.

In May 2019 Valdinei Sousa da Silva went to trial for her murder.

> Valdinei Sousa da Silva will be tried by the Jury's Court of Rondonopolis (212 km from Cuiabá) this Friday (May 24), for murder homicide due to homophobia - and by a means that made it difficult for the victim to defend herself. As reported by the 6th Prosecutor's Office of Criminal Justice, the crime happened in June 2017, in the Novo Horizonte neighborhood. [Deadname] Dias, whose social name was ""Tábata"", was killed by the accused with four gunshots.
> 
> According to the investigation, the victim was a [trans woman] and was working as a sex worker at the scene when the accused and wife arrived on a motorcycle, and, moved by feelings of prejudice and discrimination, offended Tábata and other [trans women] who were there. The victim defended herself, which angered Valdinei.
> 
> He narrates the complaint that, afterwards, ""imbued with animus necandi (intent to kill), the accused went to his home where he seized a firearm and returned alone to the scene of the crime"", shooting  Tábata four times. The victim died instantly. The accused has been in preventive custody since 2017 at the Major PM Eldo Sá Corrêa Penitentiary - ""Mata Grande"".

Haley Gabriella Feldmann,19.0,2021-11-12,North Dakota,United States of America,46.9159866,-104.0251951,suicide,suicide,"Haley died by suicide. Although her family supported her throughout her transition, the more she learned of the hostility of some others the more she had retreated into herself.

> Haley Gabriella Feldmann was born on November 18, 2002. She was called boy and so we gave her a boy name—now a dead name. We gave her boy clothes, boy toys, boy things. We didn’t know she was our daughter and so we called her son and brother. Haley spent the first several years of her life content, within and without. She knew nothing of judgment or ridicule. She knew nothing but the love of her family, which she gave back in abundance.
> 
> During her adolescent years she retreated into herself and we lost her. She became silent . . . distant. She built formidable walls that became impossible to breach, and she stubbornly refused to grant us passage. She had begun to grow afraid of the world as she began to understand herself and who she was, and the reality of her situation became apparent. The more she learned of how the world would judge her for not being who it thought she should be, the more she withdrew. She was an atheist, unable to believe in any religion or deity that taught condemnation of her for not submitting to its beliefs of who she should be. She was a child of God, made perfectly in his image, her body only a vessel for the beautiful soul He created and with which He graced us. She laughed and she loved, and though her humor was dark, her nature was light. Her kindness, her empathy, her hope for others, and her desire to help anyone in need was a blinding light she shone on everyone but herself.
> 
> Haley gave us the gift of her truth, trusted us to see beyond her body to her soul, to believe her, and to love her. We will always be grateful for the chance to have her as she was and not who we had thought her to be. Now we call her daughter and sister and we closed ranks around her to protect her and to keep her safe from the willful ignorance that surrounds her.
> Our daughter Haley spent most days wreaking havoc on the universe, her time spent being “Imperial Empress of the Galaxies, Conqueror of Solar Systems, Creator of Planets and Nations, Destroyer of Stars”, and loving and adoring Lucy, her best friend and the Best Dog Ever, who loved and adored her in equal measure. She created her own language with a full alphabet and rules, spending years revising and perfecting it, and, in typical Haley fashion, did not leave a key. She created her own maps, detailed in geography, and her own countries, rich in their histories. She dropped out of school and then graduated before her peers, which made her immensely proud. She taught herself history, geography, politics, and never hesitated to school anyone on the finer points of each. And she was usually correct.
> 
> Haley lived most comfortably in a Discord community of just under six hundred people from all over the world, each of whom loved and adored her. We are just beginning to learn of her profound impact within the community and we are grateful they had her and she was loved by them. Her soul was radiant there, unhindered by its physical representation here which had become a prison, freeing her to breathe and be.
> 
> Haley ended her life on November 12, 2021, her pain being too great. She had grown weary of the knowledge of her reality, knowing this country and this world would never stop trying to force her to submit to its ignorance, and her family rages for her. We would’ve burned the whole world down if we’d thought it would keep her safe, and our fury and outrage is eclipsed only by our grief. We struggle against the currents that try to carry us away from love, for those currents only take us further from her. And she is far enough, already.

> 
> The Eure (North-West) Court of Appeal followed the recommendations of the Public Prosecutor's Office by confirming the 30-year prison sentence handed down at first instance in July 2019 against Mimoun Moumni.

Alessa Flores Mendez,23.0,2016-10-13,Nuevo Leon,Mexico,25.859417,-99.941748,violence,strangled,"Alessa Flores was found strangled in a hotel room in the Cuauhtémoc branch of Mexico City. She had also been beaten and stabbed.

Alessa was originally from Tabasco and was engaged in sex work to survive. She was also an activist and struggled to make visible the specific security needs of women engaged in sex work.

Just a week earlier, she had participated in the Youth Capital Forum of the Youth Institute of Mexico City, where she spoke on “Sex work: Democratisation versus precarisation”. In her speech Alessa recalled that transgender sex workers lack protection and are exposed to dangers because their work is not recognized as a job.

> “Sex work is stigmatized by the idea of selling the body, an idea that the conservatives use to disqualify them because the workers make their bodies public and (for the conservatives) the women are not public, but this idea is wrong because all the workers sell his body, the same as a worker, as well as a clerk.”

Alessa had been collaborating for two years in the placement of a day of the dead altar for sex workers, some of them murdered.

> The altar was to remember them, “remember they were here and they were very good,” Alessa said in a video recorded last year in November, just in front of the altar placed by Tlalpan’s sex workers.
> 
> “I hope I do not have to be on this poster, I hope I do not end up here and end up somewhere else, sex work is an option but I would not like to do that alone,” Alessa said in the video.

Police said there were bloodstains in the house and suspect that the murderer locked the front door to delay the discovery of the body.

According to Nildo Correia, from the Gay Group of Alagoas (GGAL), Reinaldo was gay and performed as character named Adrielly Reys. “He was missing four days ago and leaves us a legacy of great wisdom and cultural richness,” lamented the leader of the group.

> “Alagoas LGBT scene says farewell to Reinaldo (makeup artist and one of the first trans performers of Alagoas). Rey as he was called by his friends gave life to the character ‘Drielly Reys’ in the nights of Maceió. He has spent a season in Europe and has always lived in the midst of fashion and entertainment.”

Although he was supported by his parents, he had also suffered conflicts and bullying at school.

> “It’s a parent’s worst nightmare.” A mother from Gatineau is crying out from the heart so that no child ever again decides to take their own life because they question their sexual orientation or gender identity.
> 
> On March 9, Annick Dinelle’s life changed. Her child, who had asked to be called Alex, rather than [deadname], committed suicide. Alex’s questions about his gender identity and sexual orientation had begun in the months leading up to his death, his mother claims.
>
> “[He] had asked us if we would accept that she was gay, lesbian or trans. [He] was looking at [himself] a lot. As his parents, he had been told that no matter [how he identified] we were always going to love him”. The child had expressed her wish to wear a [binder] around [his] chest to hide [his] curves and even to have [his] breasts completely removed. For Christmas, he also wanted to receive boxers for boys as a present.
> 
> In the fall, Alex’s parents noticed a change of attitude in their child, who showed more and more aggressive behavior, which was not like him. The mother claims her child was allegedly bullied at school. To help Alex, his parents made an appointment with a doctor, in addition to consulting social workers. Just before spring break, an intervention plan was put in place to support Alex. But that was not enough: the Wednesday following the return to class, Alex ended his life.

A coroner observed that Alex had developed precocious puberty and was struggling with the changes happening to his body.

Krys Brandon Ruiz,26.0,2021-03-28,California,United States of America,34.6390329,-120.4599919,violence,shot,"Krys was shot dead by police in circumstances which are unclear. An attorney has called for an investigation.

The officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave.

> An attorney is calling for the California Attorney General to investigate the March 28 officer-involved shooting of a Lompoc transgender male because of officials' alleged conflicts of interest in a letter sent to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office, the District Attorney's office and the Lompoc Police Department.
> 
> Krys Brandon Ruiz, 26, died from a fatal gunshot wound following an altercation with Lompoc Police officers minutes after they received a report of a person walking northbound on H Street with a handgun shortly after 8 p.m., according to Capt. Kevin Martin.
> 
> The case was turned over to the office of Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown, who was the Lompoc police chief from 1995 to 2006 before becoming Sheriff. 
> 
> Bill Schmidt, a Fresno-based attorney representing Ruiz's family, cited as a foundation for the request Government Code 12525.3, which deals with police shootings of unarmed people, and AB 1506, a law approved by the governor on Sept. 30, 2020, that requires a state prosecutor to investigate when police use deadly force. 
> 
> ""Bill Brown oversaw the recruitment and training of that city's police officers,"" Schmidt wrote in the April 7 letter addressed to the sheriff's office and the attorney general's office. ""Sheriff Brown is not only the county's top law enforcement officer, he is also the coroner, charged with determining the manner and cause of death in this and similar cases."" 
> 
> Additionally, Schmidt said the Attorney General should investigate because District Attorney Joyce Dudley helped develop statewide deadly force training and has never prosecuted an officer involved in a deadly shooting. 
> 
> Dudley confirmed receipt of Schmidt's letter on Friday, but did not offer comment and referred to the sheriff's office, which responded to an emailed inquiry, but did not provide comment. 
> 
> Neither the Lompoc Police Department nor the attorney general's office responded to requests for comment on Friday. 
> 
> An hour before the shooting, Ruiz was dropped off at his apartment by his mother after dinner, blocks away from the shooting location, according to Schmidt, adding Ruiz wasn't intoxicated or agitated. 
> 
> ""We don’t know what happened, whether they were trying to take him into custody for some reason, but we believe that it was virtually impossible that he had a gun, as far as we know,"" Schmidt said. ""The reality is that the police control all of the evidence and all of the information."" 
> 
> Schmidt believes the shooting involved poor training standards, although he added that has yet to be seen. He filed a records request Thursday with Lompoc Police to release information about the incident, including all video recordings. 


A memorial service for Krys was held on Friday 16th April. According to his obituary:

> Krys faced many challenges in his short life. At the age of seven, he was diagnosed with Type-1 Diabetes and dealt with the daily struggles of the disease with courage and strength. Family and friends rallied around him and supported his health and wellness journey.
> 
> Krys was passionate about music and he followed many artists over the years in different genres, such as: Hip Hop, R & B, Oldies, Country, Mexican and Reggae. Krys loved to sing karaoke and would sing alone or in the company of others, many times using the popular apps Smule and Tiktok. More recently, he began to write music lyrics both serious and funny in nature. He also wrote poetry. Krys loved Demi Lovato; he knew all of her songs. He found a connection to her through her life struggles and lyrics. Krys also loved Vicente Fernandez, Los Tigres del Norte, Los Freddy's, Jenni Rivera, and Selena. Music was a special talent Krys had and he will be remembered through the many musical recordings he left behind.
> 
> Krys was blessed in life with good, solid friendships over the years. He usually bonded with those that shared his love for either music or dogs. Some of Krys' special friends are, Kira Kazianka, Bri Gusman, and Baylee Roche. They all bonded and remained close friends over the years, despite distance and time.
> 
> Krys's smile lit up any room; it was very captivating. He was known for his ever-changing hair color. Along with his love of painting his face in different ways (from clown faces to scary faces and a short emo phase) he loved wearing baseball caps, comfy t-shirts, sunglasses and creative masks.

Jasper Aaron Lynch,26.0,2022-07-07,Virginia,United States of America,38.9580273,-77.1855275,violence,shot,"Aaron was shot by police during a mental health crisis.

> HRC is deeply saddened to learn of the death of Aaron Lynch, a 26-year-old transgender man who was shot and killed by police in McClean, Virginia on July 7. Aaron’s death is at least the 26th violent killing of a transgender or gender non-conforming person in 2022. We say “at least” because too often these deaths go unreported — or misreported.
> 
> At 26, Aaron had his whole life in front of him. My thoughts and prayers are with Aaron’s loved ones. Aaron’s death is a tragic result of our system’s ineffectiveness in caring for people who are struggling mentally and emotionally. People, especially those of multiple marginalized identities, suffer every day as a result. His life did not have to end like this. We demand more focus and funding on mental health care in our country, including the addition of mental health counselors to respond to certain critical situations. No family should have to bear this pain.""
> 
> On July 7, police responded to a call made by a friend who was concerned about Aaron’s wellbeing and went to his home to check in on him. It was reported that police arrived with a trained mental health co-responder but Aaron was not found on the property. Police then returned a second time without the co-responder. After a back-and-forth with police, officers attempted to tase Aaron unsuccessfully. One officer then fired his weapon, shooting Aaron four times. No officers were injured and Aaron was pronounced dead at the scene. The shooting is under investigation and all involved officers have been placed on restricted duty.
> 
> Aaron’s family released the following statement to local press:
> 
> “Our son, Aaron, was experiencing a severe mental health crisis on July 7. He was scared and asked for both of the 911 calls that were made that day. We believe that the three police officers who answered the second 911 call could have, and should have, handled this far differently. To respond to Aaron’s mental health crisis by shooting him at all, let alone multiple times, cannot be justified. We recognize that, at times, police officers face grave and unknown dangers in the line of duty, but that was not the case for that call at our home regarding our son. Aaron was about 5’ 6"", slightly built, and holding just a bottle and a decorative mask. As parents, we mourn the heartbreaking loss of our son and are left with only memories and regret. Had we known there was any possibility that the police responding to the second 911 call would use lethal force against Aaron during a mental health crisis, we would not have involved them until a mental health counselor could be present, as was the case for the response to the first 911 call. We hope our efforts to find out more about this incident will, in the future, help families in similar situations avoid such a tragic outcome.”

Dorce Gamalama,58.0,2022-02-16,Jakarta Raya,Indonesia,-6.2399349,106.7910124,medical,COVID-19,"Dorce passed away in hospital due to complications from COVID-19.

> Popular trans entertainer Dorce Gamalama has died in Indonesia from complications related to COVID-19, but her family has decided she should be buried as a man.
>
> Gamalama, a well-known pop singer and TV presenter who even had her own talkshow, the Dorce Show, passed away in hospital in Jakarta on Wednesday (16 February). She was often referred to as Bunda (mother) Dorce.
>
> The 58-year-old had been diagnosed with COVID-19 three weeks previously, and other health conditions including Alzheimer’s and diabetes increased the severe complications associated with the virus.
>
> Gamalama had been openly trans for decades, having undergone gender affirmation surgery in 1983 and even winning a legal battle to have her gender legally recognised. In an interview last month, she referenced her deteriorating health in an interview and announced: “[I would like to be buried] as I am now. Because after my surgery, I have a female genitalia, so women should bathe me, and bathe [and bury] me as a woman.”
>
> However, as a devout Muslim, she added the decision would ultimately lie with faith leaders. Following her public announcement that she would like to be buried as a woman, the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI), Indonesia’s top Islamic scholars body, said in a statement that the body of a trans person must always be buried according to their gender assigned at birth. So, despite her final wishes, her family and religious leaders decided that she should be bathed and buried as a man.
>
> Carahanna Marianne Sam, a trans campaign manager at an NGO in South Jakarta, told The Jakarta Post that despite her limited involvement with the LGBT+ community in Indonesia, Gamalama made a huge impact by being visible.
>
> “I hope we can have more Dorce Gamalamas in Indonesia,” she said.
>
> “She’s still a hero. Just by being out there and existing, she already has done more than half of what the rest of us have done.”

Nicole Galisteu,20.0,2013-01-05,Parana,Brazil,-25.366923,-49.2470586,violence,shot,"Nicole was on a night out at a club when three men propositioned her. When they discovered that she was not a cisgender woman, they killed her.

> The 20-year-old [trans woman] [deadname] Generoso, also known as “Nicole Galisteu”, was murdered last Sunday (5) in the Santa Cândida neighborhood after the men who were meeting her discovered that Galisteu was not a [cisgender] woman. The information was passed by the Homicide Police of Curitiba (DH) on Tuesday (8). According to the expert, three suspects of involvement in the crime were arrested and despite claiming to be innocent the evidence confirms their participation.
>
> “They went out in a club and two of their friends started making fun of one of them by saying they were kissing a man. When they saw that he really was a transvestite, they took the gun from the house and killed Bruno Galisteu because of this, ”said Chief Officer Rubens Recalcatti of DH.

> One of them became interested in Nicole; The two of them exchanged kisses, but a macho man noticed she was [transgender]. At this point, the (usual) game that allows the perpetuation of male domination began. Rather than drawing the straight-male friend's attention to the fact that he was interested in a [trans woman], the pack took a step in restoring his ""softness."" There is nothing wrong with a straight man being attracted to a trans woman, wanting and kissing her. Male chauvinistic codes of conduct, however, require men who claim the label of heterosexuality to be ready to do anything, to commit any brutality or insanity to prove their masculinity.
>
> Anything at all, even premeditating murder, as Nicole's murderers did. Two of them went home for a weapon while the third distracted the [trans woman] and ensured that she would not leave the club. When they returned, they continued to act as if nothing had happened and offered to take her home, on the way they got her out of the car, shot 7 times at her, then drove the car over her body. The press boasted that Nicole was murdered because she was ""mistaken for a woman."" Almost a defense of the ""prerogative"" of male domination to ""wash honor with blood"" when ""deceived"". Cheap terrorism to intimidate [trans women], so they are afraid of exactly what they are: women.

Quinn Mowrer Gustin,20.0,2022-03-24,Utah,United States of America,40.7765233,-112.0605692,suicide,suicide,"Quinn died by suicide.

> Quinn Mowrer Gustin’s mom says Quinn loved animals more than anything. She had an affinity for stray cats, and would regularly feed them. She was always there for her friends, and always knew how to make the people around her laugh. She was unapologetically trans and queer. She was always willing to defend anyone from the hatred of the world. Quinn lost her battle with mental health on March 24.

*[Editor's Note: We don't know where Quinn passed away, but as she was from Salt Lake CIty that is the location given on this page.]*

Her family were supportive, but as every trans person knows, there is nearly always *someone* who you once trusted who lets you down. The following (extracted from an article by her mum written 5 months before her death) tells a heartening but heartbreakingly familiar story:

> November of 2017, my kiddo told me she was transgender and was a girl. This actually didn’t shock me at all – or even register too big. I kind of assumed it was a phase because of the boyfriend, but she had been prepping me over time so it wasn’t hard to hear. Honestly, I heard it but didn’t even register. I didn’t realize until about two years later that it had been her coming out moment! She didn’t feel the need to “keep it a secret” and said we could tell anyone we wanted – which, at the time, was no one!
> 
> The next month, we traveled to spend Christmas with family. I decided that my family members were the realest friends I had and I should “prep” them so that our now daughter could come out to them. The reaction from my in-laws was textbook awesome and they were SO compassionate and supportive. I went for a ride with two of my siblings and told them and they also were amazing. They expressed concern for my wellbeing but loved my kiddo unconditionally. They didn’t know anything about transgender people, but loved my daughter enough that it didn’t even matter.
> 
> Seems like a dream come true – but not quite. The hardest part came later that afternoon with our family gathering of about 20 (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc). One family member, who didn’t know about my kiddo yet, because time hadn’t allowed, started talking about the “weird” cashier at the local grocery store and how they were so uncomfortable because they don’t know if “it” was a He or She. The conversation went on and on in the most horribly transphobic fashion regardless of how many times I tried to subtly steer it in a more positive way. I hadn’t yet learned to breath fire and was more worried that my kiddo had left the room when the conversation started, than I was about teaching those making the terrible remarks how damaging they were. To this day, my child prefers to not be with this family member because she feels she saw their true colors before they knew she was transgender. It didn’t matter that I had tried to stand up for trans people – my daughter was crying and angry (at me, because she could) for not being a strong enough ally for the checker who was being persecuted behind their back. My fire had been lit and I vowed never to allow that in my presence from anyone.
> 
> That fall, she was using the new name with everyone and asked all of her teachers to call her Quinn. She presented exclusively female. She broke up with the toxic boyfriend. One day, I was approached by the yearbook teacher and asked how they should list her in the yearbook. I said I thought she would prefer to be called Quinn – but I would confirm. I casually mentioned it to Quinn and asked what she wanted. She sat up from lounging gloomily on the couch and with a look of awe and wonderment asked if I really would allow her to be listed as Quinn.
> 
> You know those moments where it feels like the clouds clear, the heavens shine down radiant heavenly beams, and the angels are singing because there is PURE JOY on your child’s face? This was that moment for us! After all of the pain and turmoil and hurt, this was our moment. It was the look on your child’s face the first time they see fireworks explode in the night sky, or on Christmas morning when piles of presents have appeared, or the magical look of true love. I would never be Public Enemy #1 again, and she would be Quinn forever.
> 
> Yes, she could be listed as Quinn and once again – it was us against the world.
> 
> We fought the fight against dysphoria together. I cried with her when she didn’t recognize her own reflection as herself. I never complained when she would shower in the dark or run the steamy shower for way too long so she couldn’t see her reflection in the mirror. I waxed her eyebrows, upper lip, and armpits. I helped her get eyelash extensions and learn to straighten her hair. I still try hard to understand why sleeping in jeans is emotionally the safest, even though I don’t “get it”. After many ups and downs, in April of 2019, after she decided to graduate a year early, we decided to look into hormone options. We found a terrific doctor who really worked to educate us and help us make the best decisions. The day she got her first prescription for testosterone blockers and estrogen shots – we celebrated! It was the best day of her life up to that point!!!

> The dawn remained silent until the thin man began to scream. ""Why the fuck are you looking at me, shit goats!"" He exclaimed, according to several witnesses on the block. The woman who accompanied him joined in immediately: ""Maricones! You are never going to be women. Pichulones, I do have a vagina! ""
> 
> The woman, with a motorcycle helmet in her right hand, tried to hit Claudia and her colleagues on the street. After a few minutes of struggle and a brief exchange of blows and shoves, the couple left on a motorcycle, threatening loudly that they would return to kill them.
> 
> Almost an hour after the street brawl at just after 6 in the morning, the threats of the aggressor couple were fulfilled. Four people on two bikes stopped abruptly in front of the Hotel Las Vegas and one of them, without taking off his helmet, shot four bullets at Claudia - hitting here in the arm (near the shoulder), head, back and hip. A fifth bullet hit a passer-by on the leg identified as Jesús Montesinos Álvarez (30).
> 
> Two of the other sex workers who were with Claudia managed to enter the Hotel Las Vegas and, after a struggle with the shooter, shut the door. The slogan of the executioner was clear: to kill all the trans women he met on his way.
> 
> ""They killed a fag!"" Shouted the receptionist on duty at the nearby hotels. Another receptionist told Wayka that she even heard more than 5 shots and that she did not want to see Claudia's body on the floor, face down, half stooped, with a pool of blood under her face and another half a meter away, suggesting that she had crawled before she died.

Claudia was a trans activist, human rights defender and founder of Jóvenes Cambiando VIHdas, the HIV Youth Network in Peru.

> Today, in the day of trans visibility, various activists will meet in the place where they murdered Claudia to ask for justice for her and for all trans women murdered by transphobic violence and state neglect.
> 
> Sandy Sussel, trans activist and Claudia's partner, told Presentes that the sit-in that will be held at 5 PM seeks to do justice for Claudia, ""Because when it comes to a trans woman, the police do not investigate, they do not care who kills us and why?""
> 
> Various organizations and activists lament Claudia's death and demand the enactment of laws such as the law against hate crimes that protect the lives of trans people, who find themselves in a situation of total exclusion by the Peruvian State.
> 
> From the Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) of Peru they said: ""We regret the violent departure of Claudia Vera, trans fellow activist of Jóvenes Cambiando VIHdas, who contributed a lot to her outstanding work in favor of the community. Our condolences to friends and family. ""
> 
> The organization Sí a vida said: ""Not one more death! The human rights of transgender, gay, lesbian, bisexual and intersex people (TLGBI) are not backed by norms and laws in the country. Today one of our instructors and volunteers was killed by several shots at point-blank range in the public thoroughfare in the district of Independencia. The young activist and promoter of HIV prevention Claudia Vera, fought for trans women to live in a society free of violence and hate crimes are punished severely in the penal code.
> 
> Argentine activist for the rights of people with HIV Mariana Iacono wrote: ""I am deeply saddened. They murdered our beloved Claudia Vera. The first young trans woman to organize a meeting of young people with HIV in the history of Jóvenes Positivos LAC in Peru. Founder of the network of young people with HIV in Peru. With all her difficulties and help from other people she did not stop until she did it.
> 
> Trans hate - hatred for sex workers continue to kill them throughout Latin America. We ask for justice for Claudia, our friend and companion. Today Latin America and the Caribbean are in mourning because someone who thought the world could be a little better died. ""

> This is Kai. Kai was born June 4, 2003. I met Kai a couple of days after I moved into the Barton Community College dorms. We clicked instantly. Kai was funny, kind, and all-around a great person. We ate lunch together almost every day and even took composition one together. Honestly, he was a good person, and I will say that until my dying breath. Unfortunately, others did not think he was because of the way Kai identified himself. Kai was transgender. If you don't know this about me, I fully support the LGBTQ+ community and will say it with my entire chest.

Kai was studying to be an MLT but also wanted to be a nurse. He was apparently scared of how people would treat him for being trans, or that people would refuse his care.

> A transgender woman was fatally shot Saturday inside her apartment in southwest Houston, police said.  
> 
> The woman, who has not been publicly identified, was found with multiple gunshot wounds in the apartment in the 6600 block of Dunlap. Her boyfriend initially called police at 8 p.m. after coming upon her body, according to police. 
> 
> Police said the woman appeared to live alone, and the door was unlocked when officers arrived. They found multiple shell casings in the apartment. 
> 
> According to a recent report from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, last year was the deadliest on record for transgender and gender non-conforming people with at least 47 killed. 
> 
> Anyone with information about the Houston case can call the Houston Police Department's homicide division at 713-308-3600 or Crime Stoppers 713-222-TIPS (8477).

Paloma's identity only emerged subsequently. She had emigrated to the USA from Latin America 6 months earlier.

> The transgender woman shot to death in Houston has been identified as 29-year-old immigrant Paloma Vazquez.
>
> Vazquez, who was not identified in initial reports, was found dead in her apartment just days before Texas Gov. Greg Abbott directed the state to interpret trans-affirming care as child abuse. According to the Organization for Latina Trans in Texas, Vazquez immigrated to the United States six months ago.
>
> “As most trans women who are here from Latina America, they are here because they are scared of being killed in their own country,” a friend of the victim, Gia Pacheco, told KTRK Houston. “She had just moved into her new apartment and was very excited about decorating.”
>
> Another friend, Valentin Terrazas noted that Latin America can be particularly dangerous for transgender women. Transgender women, particularly Black and Latinx women, also face high rates of violence across the United States.
>
> “There’s a lot of transphobia in Latin America,” friend Valentin Terrazas added. “They come here for refuge and to better their lives and have a future here.”

Paloma had only arrived in the USA 6 months earlier, having fled Honduras because of the violence there.

> Vazquez, who had arrived in the U.S. six months ago, was involved with the Organization for Latina Trans in Texas. A spokesperson for the group told the Daily News that the 29-year-old was from Honduras and that she had fled her native country because she was afraid of being targeted because she was trans.
>
> On Thursday, a large group of friends, human rights activists, as well as members of the transgender community gathered outside Houston City Hall to honor her life and bring attention to the alarming increase in the number of killings of transgender women of color in the U.S.

Techi,45.0,2019-05-29,Arequipa,Peru,-16.404093,-71.543837,suicide,possible suicide,"Techi's body was found in the waters of the rio del Chili on 29th May. She had last been seen three days earlier.

Her death is being treated as a possible suicide.

> Techi's body had been dragged by the waters of the Chili River. The rocks contained it. She was almost naked, apparently the waters ripped off her clothes. An orange polo shirt wrapped around his face. It was impossible to say how long the corpse was submerged in the torrent. A neighbor notified the police of the find. While the body of the victim was removed, radios and virtual channels gave account of their physical features: a man of 45 to 50 years.
>
> The tragedy of Techi hit members of the trans community of Arequipa . She left home on May 26, and three days later, she was a corpse. The investigation considers a possible suicide, but the fact that her body had a polo shirt covering her face awakens the suspicion of this community, so tormented by violence and impunity.
> 
> Do you think it is a hate crime ? Ana Flavia Chávez, a transsexual woman, points out that determining that in Arequipa is difficult, as the law does not ensure a transparent investigation. For the law, only the body of a man was found in the river, there is no way to account for the fact that it was a person belonging to a vulnerable group.
> 
> In life Techi was encouraged to admit her gender identity at an already mature age. Ana Flavia says she started wearing tight clothes and letting her hair grow. This process was interrupted because her clients stopped buying from her. Then she went back to dressing as before while selling merchandise on the Andrés Avelino Cáceres shopping platform. The autopsy conducted on her body indicates that Techi was HIV+.

> Bella Pugh, a Black gender non-confirming [Editor's Note: this is incorrect] teen, was shot to death after a Christmas party erupted into a night of violence earlier this month. The 19-year-old was slain at a residence in Rosedale Avenue in Prichard, Alabama on 13 December.
> 
> Reports suggest that after Pugh was shot, party-goers waited 20 minutes before calling emergency services. Some did nothing, others took out their mobile phones and recorded.
> 
> Pugh’s mother Tiffany told Fox10 News that it was their rainbow-coloured jumpsuit that led to their murder, saying: “If [they] wasn’t wearing that dress [they] would still be alive.”
> 
> At least two other people attending the party were also injured, according to the Prichard City Police Department. Officers added that a suspect, James Lee James Jr, turned himself in for questioning 16 December, NBC15 News reported.
> 
> He was later charged with murder and two counts of second-degree assault – however, authorities said that they are not investigating Pugh’s death as a hate crime. Their family disagree with the decision.
> 
> Tiffany believes Pugh “was killed because of what [they] was wearing, not because of who [they] was or what [they] did. I loved [them] with everything in me, that’s why [they] could shine like [they] did. Everything I had I poured into [Bella].”
> 
> Pugh’s father Antonio Ruggs reflected: “Love your kids for who they are. Because you know one day they could be here, the next day they can be gone,” he added, according to MyNBC15.

 Jaheim did not identify as trans, but was a newly out cisgender gay man who was exploring his identity.

> Kudos to HRC for honoring Jaheim Bella Pugh, a murdered cisgender gay man on their TDoR page.
> 
> The trouble is that HRC identifies Jaheim Bella Pugh as a Gender Non-Conforming‘ person. While technically correct this term is easily conflated and misunderstood as it describes gender, not sex.
> 
> Jaheim Bella Pugh, according to his mother, was a 19-year-old cisgender gay man just beginning to learn who he was. Bella was the name of his new puppy which he adopted as his drag name.
> 
> After thorough research, I could not find anywhere that he self-identified as a gender non-conforming or transgender person. There was one person who posted a tribute identifying Bella as transgender but that has since been refuted by multiple sources.
> 
> The whole idea behind the TDoR project which honors our dead is to investigate with integrity each individual and how they died. This is critical so that we may know who they were. Prior to the first TDoR, a trans-peer-led initiative, those who murdered us were arrested but never served jail time for their crimes.
> 
> However, there is no honor in superimposing a narrative that fits your needs while intentionally disregarding facts about a person’s life and death.

One report even claims that the paramedics stood on a street corner smoking and drinking while she was suffering.

> After the long wait, Alejandra finally received medical attention. However, this was not encouraging, as she facing not only the respiratory condition but now also discrimination from the paramedics, who, leaving aside their code of ethics, made value judgments about the patient when they knew her HIV positive condition . The attitude they assumed was immediately negative, the witness tells us, and the more time passed, the worse Alejandra's situation got.
>
> There was talk of a possible ""Overdose"", a diagnosis given without evidence, that ""what she presented was going to go down"", that she should calm down and not take anything to eat because she could choke, but at that time she was already drowning.
>
> ""NO, you see her wrong, I'm very scared, please take her to the hospital, my God!"" Diana [Alejandra's friend] begged the first aid personnel, but the only response they received was that she could not be transferred to a Medical Center because she had no symptoms of Covid. The indications they gave her were to be aware that ""this is going to go down"" (referring to the alleged overdose) A diagnosis that cost her her life.
>
> Despite seeing her without air and having taken oxygen in the ambulance, they did nothing more to help her and preferred to go to a corner to drink red wine and smoke a cigarette, showing a callous and inhuman attitude.

Ty Underwood,24.0,2015-01-26,Washington,United States of America,47.4361,-117.782501,violence,shot,"Ty was shot to death in her car. Her last communication had been with a potential date via a chat app but she had been beginning to have doubts about him.

Carlton Ray Champion Jr., 21, was convicted of first degree murder.

> A confession never comes, but there's enough evidence to put Carlton Champion in front of a jury.
> 
> ""He kind of laughed and chuckled the whole time,"" said Ty Underwood's friend Kenyaah Darks. ""You see his lawyer kind of like tapping him telling him to be quiet, straighten up, sit up and things like that, and he took it as a joke.""
> 
> But it's no joke when the verdict comes in: Guilty of first-degree murder. He could have received as little as five years, but after another outburst of arrogance in court, Champion gets life.
> 
> But even that life sentence doesn't stop him from taunting still members of Ty's family as he leaves the courtroom.
> 
> ""Carlton Champion Jr. killed Ty Underwood because he was afraid the secret was gonna come out, that if this relationship went south, everyone was gonna find out that he's in a relationship with a transgender woman, and he could not take that thought,"" said Cory McCoy.
> 
> Unbelievably, Carlton Champion still thinks he can get out of this. He sent a letter to Crime Watch Daily, writing ""the police did dirty work"" and that he's ""looking good, feeling good... Waiting to get free so I can see what the world got to offer me.""
> 
> Champion's lawyer indicated his client will appeal. Carlton Champion will be eligible for parole in 2045.

Ty was employed as a nursing assistant at a retirement home and was planning to enter a nursing program at Kilgore College in Longview, Texas.

> ""Ty was a person who wasn't scared of anything,"" said Ty's friend Kenyaah Darks. ""Ty wasn't fearful, so when it came down to the world accepting who she was, it was 'live it to the fullest every day, because you just never know.'""

Immediately, the members of the section arrived at the place, an opportunity in which they observed the body without life and upside down that had women's clothes.

> I can't even begin to explain the pain that my heart feels. Such a wonderful, caring, loving, woman was taken out of this world—for what reason?

She was ignored by doctors and refused access to either the male or female wards following complaints from staff and patients. She died of her injuries on Wednesday morning.

Alisha was the Peshawar coordinator and one of eight board members of Trans Action Alliance, an advocacy group that has been increasingly vocal in seeking equal rights for transgender people in the province.

In Facebook posts, Trans Action said the gang that shot Alesha specifically targets members of the transgender community, and sometimes sexually assaults them while recording the crime.

> For an hour, while Alesha bled, doctors couldn't decide whether to admit her to the men's or women's ward, according to Trans Action. When they finally decided on the men's ward, Trans Action protested, and had her moved to the women's ward, where other women apparently complained.
> 
> Then the taunts began, Trans Action said. One doctor allegedly asked a Trans Action volunteer for her telephone number and how much she charges for a dancing party. Another was reportedly asked if her breasts were real. Another asked if the women from Trans Action just danced or also ""perform sex,"" according to the group.

In July 2019 Fazal Dayan alias Fazal Gujjar was convicted of her murder and sentenced to death. His co-accused Rehmatullah was aquitted due to a lack of evidence.

However, in February 2021 the conviction was set aside on appeal.

> PESHAWAR: A Peshawar High Court bench on Tuesday acquitted an accused person charged with murder of a transgender person Alishah, whose death had resulted into public outcry in 2016, and set aside the sentence of death awarded to him by a trial court.
>
> The bench of Justice Roohul Amin Khan and Justice Syed M Attique Shah accepted an appeal filed by the convict, Fazal Dayan alias Fazal Gujjar, ruling that the prosecution failed to prove its case against the appellant.

What we do know is that the girls of Tucumán are constantly in danger. In addition to feeling the anguish that they are killing us, that friends and acquaintances die, that because we are trans we are afraid of going out into the street and sometimes of going to the center to work. I do not know if I’m going back. I am afraid and it is not a sensation, it is a reality: they are killing us, they are destroying our bodies and our lives”, Mahia Moyano, an activist with LOTO (Freedom and Pride Trans Organized), told Presentes.

One suspect was arrested in September 2019, but Cynthia's family believe others were also involved.

> On February 14, 2018, Cynthia Moreira , 25, left home. Five days later her body was found, dismembered, inside two bags, by a man who was performing maintenance tasks in a house on 9 de Julio 1,500, in Villa Amalia. A member of the Díaz clan was arrested for this crime, but it was always suspected that there were more involved.
>
> “We still do not have a date but the case was brought to trial with a detainee; we believe there were three more involved. We asked that Maia Amaya , a trans girl who accompanied Cynthia and whom witnesses said they saw with her between February 14 and 15, be investigated; she denies that. We believe that she is trying to cover up something or for someone, ""said Laura Moreira. The young woman added that she does not believe that Amaya did that out of fear: “she never approached my family after the crime, nor did she accompany us on the marches; in fact she made fun of certain things, which made her an unloved person among trans girls. I think she is not lying out of fear but because she was involved”. Moreira considered that it is already known who the implicated were, and that she is waiting for their capture.

In September 2022 Ramón Soria was acquitted of her murder due to insufficient evidence.

Local media reported that she may have died after fleeing from a taxi driver to avoid paying him, but reading between the lines it sounds like she might have been beaten and robbed elseware and either flagged down a cab to escape or been attacked by the taxi driver himself, before running away and entering the building where she died.

An investigation for the crime of culpable homicide was opened by the police. As her body was found with breasts exposed and trousers open it is presumed that she also suffered an attempted sexual assault.

While demanding justice from Shireen Mazari, activist Shaan Taseer had said that the Christian and transgender community are subjected to persecution in Pakistan. “Your [Shireen Mazari] urgent intervention is required to reassure us that Pakistan is for all,” he added.

According to reports, almost 50 members of transgender community have been killed and more than 300 have faced sexual harassment and assault during the last four years in KP alone. Moreover, gender discrimination has forced the community to indulge in prostitution – that has exposed it to the hazards of HIV AIDS.

A 35 year old suspect has been arrested. He is also accused of stabbing a Moroccan man to death 12 hours later.

A statement from MozaiQ (https://www.facebook.com/mozaiqromania/) said:

> ""We would like to stop and remember Laura, a Romanian woman who worked in Italy, recently killed in a attack. Every year we remember that people still are victims of violence, even in Europe. Italy has one of the most serious statistics on violence against persons. It is important to make our voices heard, to go public against such horrible crimes.
> 
> ""With each act of violence is a system of oppression of persons. It is our duty to stress that there are still problems in our societies. In Romania, the people have fewer opportunities to succeed in life because the transition process is extremely long and humiliating, access to healthcare is restricted, while access to the labour market remains a problem. We are with our brothers and sisters. Laura's death will not be in vain, because we will always have her memory in our hearts.""

Neko had realised that she was female in 2016 and started hormone therapy. She attended university in Utah (USA), but was forced to terminate her studies and return home to China after her parents terminated her fees.

After returning China, Neko lived in Shanghai until her parents found her and her father intimidated her into going back home to Yunnan with them. She finally escaped his abuse by dying by suicide several days after he forcibly enrolled her in a militarised training camp.

> While her friend was defending her in front of her father and suggesting sending her to a hospital in Beijing, Neko’s father beat her heavily.
> 
> Neko’s father once rudely said that her friend should not “interfere with their domestic issues” while he received Neko’s friend’s call to check her up. Her father even refused to pay the medical fee, claiming that he did not have the responsibility when Neko had medical emergencies and needed to go to the hospital.
> 
> On 16 March 2018 Neko was sent by her father to a militarized training camp, Kunming Anning Good Children Sansheng Education and Training School, which claims to provide “specialized education for those Children who are rebellious, autistic, hate school or have internet addiction disorder” with entirely closed, forceful and militarized management and strict surveillance system.
> 
> Neko sent her close friends signals for help. When her close friend tried to contact her, it transpired that Neko’s mobile phone was lost, and her parents refused to reply. Her friend said that she tried to call the police, but it did not change anything.
> 
> The police claimed that they could not help, telling her that even an adult with depression at any degree with or without the certificate of incapacity “could be forcibly controlled” by parents as guardians.

> The Civil Police are investigating the death of a 51-year-old [trans woman], who was murdered at a bus stop this Thursday (12th), in the Granja de Freitas neighborhood, in the eastern region of Belo Horizonte. According to the Military Police, the suspect in the crime is a 16-year-old teenager who was apprehended. 
>
> The victim was murdered with two shots to the head and the motivation was a disagreement between victim and suspect. The teenager was arrested and said the [trans woman] had thrown a bottle of coffee at him and the suspect had since intended to kill the victim. 
>
> Before the murder of the [trans woman], the teenager had already gone to her house and shot the residence twice. According to witnesses, the suspect is responsible for frightening residents who rent houses illegally in the block of houses where the victim lived. 

On Friday 13th March a teenager was arrested in connection with the murder.

Yaritza had moved from Peru to Argentina three years earlier after experiencing systemic discrimination in her birth country.

> She was born on December 6, 1991 in Peru and had lived in Argentina for three years. Her family heard the news last Sunday. Her mother is a housewife and her father a taxi driver. He traveled to Buenos Aires this weekend to identify her body. ""Her mother, her brother Cristian and I are very sad. My daughter was a very calm, good girl who loved little animals. We talked on the phone often, and the last time, she asked her mother, 'If something happens to me, will you take me and take care of my animals?' She said they had threatened her,"" Carlos Alberto told Presentes.
> 
> Yaritza survived through sex work. She lived with two dogs and a cat in a two-room apartment, on the eighth floor of a building in Balvanera. Her neighbors worried because they stopped seeing her and her pets were restless. Friends had a bad feeling: it was not normal for Yaritza to not answer their calls. ""They approached the building and as nobody answered, they and the neighbors decided to call 911. They also communicated with the person who rented the apartment to enter. The Homicide Division entered and found her body. She had been dead a few days without life, ""Marcela Tobaldi, coordinator of the Rosa Naranja, told Presentes.
> 
> Yaritza had approached this organization to ask for advice on the procedures to make the gender change.
> 
> ""We met sometimes,"" recalls Tobaldi. ""She started going to the Defensoría, where I work. Then we got together in La Rosa Naranja and we had some friends around to my house. She was a sweet girl, very loving. She recently called to say that her updated ID had come through. 
>
> This weekend, Tobaldi and Yaritza's friends met with the father of the victim to see how to move forward. ""I want Justice to be done,"" he said. ""At 13 or 14 we already knew who Yaritza was. I accepted her and did not want her to leave. But she wanted to make her life in her own way, that nobody told her anything, that's why she left Peru with a friend. I studied computer science and worked. My daughter finished high school, but there they all discriminated against her. In Peru it is like that,"" says the father.
> 
> For La Rosa Naranja, Tobaldi asks: ""we want the UFEM (Special Prosecutor in Violence against Women and LGBT + people) - which intervened in Diana Sacayán's transvesticide investigation - to be part of this investigation as well"" . There are strong suspicions that the crime was committed by someone who knew her. Her companions believe that she was suffocated and beaten on the head.
> 
> Tobaldi adds: ""The fact that she is a migrant must be highlighted. Justice is not the same for a poor person, trans and migrant as for a trans and middle class Argentinian. It is proven that transgender people suffer double discrimination because they are migrants and the structural and systematic discrimination that transgender people have. They suffer double. Being a transvestite in the city of Buenos Aires means paying a very high price in life and also in the final destination, death. ""

> The body of a transsexual woman was found along Via Prenestina in Rome. The discovery was made earlier today, Tuesday 22 June and took place in the Quarticciolo area, near viale Palmiro Togliatti.
>
> At about 7.40 am, a report was made of a lifeless body inside a water drainage channel at street number 486, at the intersection with via Conversano, by a passerby who stopped a patrol of the Compagnia di Roma Montesacro passing through the area and requested an ambulance. The local carabinieri intervened at the scene, but unfortunately there was nothing for the woman to do except to note her death, which was confirmed by the 118 health workers who arrived by ambulance. Soldiers of the Investigative Unit of via in Selci also arrived to conduct scientific surveys and collect evidence.
> 
> The coroner and the magistrate on duty arrived on viale Palmiro Togliatti today for the first on-site checks. Those who investigated and carried out the first checks on the body found a wound on the forehead, which does not exclude any hypothesis, including murder. Subsequent post-mortem examinations will clarify the causes that led to the death. At the moment little information is known, the investigators are at work and it is not clear how the body got inside the canal, if anyone abandoned it and then left. Every hypothesis is currently being examined and the investigators are not revealing any further information but do not exclude any leads.


The subsequent autopsy concluded that Adrieli was killed.

If it is no longer a mystery  how  she died, now the mystery is about who killed Adrieli that night. As reported by La Repubblica  for days, the Carabinieri have been engaged in investigations: they listen to the woman's friends, other young trans girls and [sex workers] who could provide clues. However, so far there is no suspect. 
>
> Adrieli, who was of South American origin, was found on the morning of last June 22, in a canal of the Quarticciolo - a few steps from the Prenestina. The hypothesis of robbery was immediately ruled out, since the young Adrieli had twenty euros with her in her purse, but not her cell phone. Could it be that the phone contains important clues? 
>
> However, it is now the turn of the autopsy now to speak: bruises and scratches were found on her body - signs of an assault. Perhaps the young woman was attacked by her own client or by another person. The head wound - identified when the body was found - could also be consistant with a blow from a stick. In short, someone Adrieli killed her now it is up to the military to reconstruct what happened and who is responsible.

    All of the streets around here are No Standing zones.
    These pavements belong to the quick, and you move too slowly to follow.
 
    You slink along with a chaplet of roses about your orange hair,
    A sunset kaleidoscope visible only in flashes as I rush past.

    Today, I turned onto an unfamiliar street to find it empty and unhurried.
    Beyond the fibro houses, in among the scrub, I watched a ball of fire gently burning.

    I followed at a tiptoe, and lay down in that place until I was alone again.
    I am coming home with a flower tucked discreetly behind my ear.

Penelope's murder took place in the same week that the bodies of [Serena Angelique Velázquez](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2020/04/22/serena-angelique-velazquez_humacao-puerto-rico_0c1d649d) and [Layla Pelaez Sánchez](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2020/04/22/layla-pelaez-sanchez_humacao-puerto-rico_f1a4dfcc) were found inside a burnt out car in Humacao - less than 50km away.

> A third transgender woman was killed this week in Puerto Rico, part of an ongoing “epidemic of violence” targeting the LGBTQ community. At least nine people have been killed since January 2019.
>
> The bodies of two transgender women were found inside a badly burned car earlier this week.
>
> There is no longer any doubt, this is an epidemic of anti-LGBT+ violence,” activist Pedro Julio Serrano said. “The police have the obligation to disclose the status of the investigations of at least eight murders, one death without a determined cause, and several attacks in which LGBTQ people have been injured since January 2019.”
>
> Penélope Díaz Ramírez was killed on April 13. Her death was not reported until now.
>
> The two other victims as Layla Peláez and Serena Angelique Velázquez Ramos by local activists. Police say DNA testing will be required to officially identify the women, but Peláez’s grandmother was able to identify her granddaughter’s car when she saw it on the local news.
>
> “Never in my career have I seen so many reports of deaths of our transgender and gender non-conforming community in such a short time in one location,” Tori Cooper, director of the Human Rights Campaign‘s transgender justice initiative, said after the latest murder.
>
> “Penélope did not deserve to die. Transgender people do not deserve to die. Every single advocate, ally, elected official, and community member must stand up in light of this horrific news and say ‘No more.’ What we are doing is not enough.”
>
> “Transgender and gender non-conforming people, especially women of color,” she added, “are too often the victims of a toxic mix of transphobia, racism, and misogyny.”
>
> “They are hunting us,” Serrano said.

Any clarifications would be welcome.

The hashtags #RIPAhya and #JusticeForAhya trended on Facebook in the Philippines in the days following her murder.

Her Facebook profile is https://www.facebook.com/I.love.AHYA and her Twitter account https://twitter.com/URsweethartAHYA. Her murder was not included in the official TDoR 2017 list.

Sherin Celin Mathew,26.0,2022-05-17,Kerala,India,9.9897354,76.3132072,suicide,suicide,"Sherin died by suicide.

> Sherin Celin Mathew, a 26-year-old trans woman from Kerala, who was an actor and model, was found dead in a rented apartment at Chakkaraparambu in Kochi, on Tuesday, May 17. She was from the neighbouring Alappuzha district and had been staying here for two years. The news comes merely days after the death of another Kerala model, Sahana.
> 
> Sherin was reportedly suffering from depression due to some personal differences with a few of her friends. A police officer said a case of unnatural death has been registered and prima facie it appeared to be a suicide, and that a detailed probe was going on. Speaking to TNM, police said that investigation is underway at the scene and her body will be sent for a postmortem soon.
> 
> On May 12, Sahana, a young model and small-time actor from Kozhikode, was found dead in her house on her 21st birthday in an apparent case of suicide. In July 2021, Kerala’s first transgender radio jockey [Anannyah Kumari Alex](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2021/07/20/anannyah-kumari-alex_kochi-kerala-india_16867eed) was also believed to have died by suicide, days after she had alleged gross medical negligence in her sex reassignment surgery. After her friends and family protested against the hospital – Renai Medicity – and Dr Arjun Asokan, who did the surgery, Kerala Health Minister Veena George ordered a probe into Anannyah’s death.
> 
> Recently in April, a fact-finding report on her death alleged gross medical negligence by the private hospital and sought better healthcare for trans persons in the state, and for medical professionals to follow international norms. The fact-finding team has also asked for a second post-mortem of Anannyah’s body, and has said that the police investigation into the death was shoddy.

Gianna Lombardi,48.0,2021-01-18,Apulia,Italy,41.227674,16.294755,uncategorised,not reported,"Gianna lived in poverty, in a home without heating or light. After she died her birth family tried to quietly erase her identity, but news of her death went viral in Italy.

> A case of transphobia in the city of Andria where Gianna died, a transgender person who is remembered by her family on funeral posters with a man's name, which we will not repeat. The first to denounce the gesture was Vladimir Luxuria through a [tweet](https://twitter.com/vladiluxuria/status/1351618695840329731), telling what happened with the commitment and disdain for the new case of transphobia that took place in Puglia.
>
> Luxuria wrote: ""A transgender person, Gianna, indigent and discarded by society, dies in Andria. The family decides to put up funeral posters with his male name (which I prefer not to repeat). An offense to the name and identity with which everyone knew her"".
> 
> Riccardo Pirrone, SMM of Taffo Funeral Services replied to Vladimir. Taffo is a funeral agency known for its ability to comment on reality with irony, and he offered to redo the posters and spread them virally on the net, in response to the transphobic actions [of Gianna's birth family].


Gianna was desperately poor and had never been accepted by her family. Vladamir had met her some time before during a discussion about civil rights and transphobia in the city.

> Among the voices that of Gianna rose, remembered by Luxuria to the Messenger with sincere condolences: “As she spoke it was clear to everyone that she no longer wanted to be insulted. She asked for a hearing, a council house. I was struck by the dignity of her person, that which does not depend on social class or gender identity - it is something much deeper, like those eyes of her mixed with rimmel and tears.
>
> After the debate I wanted to get to know her better, I realized she was a person who had been through all sorts of things. Feeling rejected by everyone, she had found refuge in alcohol and today, unfortunately, I received the news of her death and also of these absurd funeral posters. I wanted to testify to my closeness to a person ""discriminated against by the square"". Because of her [gender identity] but also because one cannot live in a house without heating or electricity, concluded Vladimir.


Funeral home staff themselves are fed up with birth families treating deceased trans people in this way:

> Among the thousands of comments on Taffo's post  who shared the correct version of the manifesto on his page, the comment of a fellow citizen stands out who confirms: ""I'm from Andria, I knew and saw her every day. Working in a funeral home before, I talked to my former colleagues and they too had problems making condolence posters because the family wanted everything in a male name. Unfortunately her family has never accepted her ... and it is precisely for this reason that she suffered"".
>
> ""Using her male name is an offense to the identity with which everyone knew her"": this is how @taffofuneralservices decided to offer her enormous media exposure for the final, and most respectful, greeting to GIANNA, the transgender person of Andria passed away in recent days apparently due to an accidental fall on which investigations are still underway by the Carabinieri.

> A [trans woman] who had been missing for four days was found dead by relatives at the Instituto Médico Legal (IML) in Belo Horizonte on Sunday (31).
> 
> Information shows that Michele Almeida, 45, was stabbed to death under a viaduct in the capital of Minas Gerais. Michele was a student at Transvest, an NGO coordinated by city councilwoman Duda Salabert that aims to combat transphobia and facilitate the inclusion of transgender people in society. 
> 
> According to the councilwoman, Michele's death may have been related to her marginalization.
> 
> ""According to reports, 77% of murders of [trans people] in Brazil take place with exaggerated violence, exquisite cruelty, and she was possibly murdered doing [sex work]. Because of society's prejudice about 90% of [trans women] in Brazil are unfortunately [sex workers]. That is why it is important for us to fight for the employability of [trans people] people as a way to combat this structural hatred"", she explained.
> 
> Duda Salabert said she will file a formal complaint with the Civil Police, demanding further investigations into the crime against Michele Almeida.

I called her brother now and came across the transphobia: he told me that the IML is bureaucratizing the release of the body, because according to the IML ""he is a man with a woman's document, so he has to go through other processes"".

It classifies the savage act as a hate crime and orders the authorities that administer justice to punish the murderer, in the shortest possible time, with the full weight of the law. It also ensures that this murder confirms the intolerance of this society towards LGBTI populations.
> 
> At dawn on May 10, the murder of 27-year-old [deadname] Fernández Villanueva, known in trans society by the name of Reina, was reported. The act of blood occurred inside the company ""Multiservicios Favicel"", located in the La Casona shopping center, in the center of the city of Nauta.

> The police authorities together with the representatives of the Public Ministry of the jurisdiction, showed that the body of the young trans woman was cruelly stabbed which led to her death.
> 
> Carol Carlobi Ríos - President of the Trans Network of Loreto, representing her organization, was outraged by the cruel murder of Reina for what she classifies as a hate crime. ""... from the network after we want to express our total repudiation, we demand that the person or persons responsible for such a deplorable act be investigated in a free manner and punished.
> 
> Likewise, Carlobi did not hesitate to accuse that this murder could be a reflection of the type of society in which we live. ""... one more trans death and this can attest once again to the hatred or cruelty towards trans people.""
> 
> Finally, Carol urged the media to respect gender identity. ""... Reina's death, at the hands of an intolerant murderer, also makes it clear to us that we are victims of femicide and the state does not want to see it as such."" (Patrick López)

Joice Freitas Vieira,32.0,2014-01-28,Para,Brazil,-1.292703,-47.92239,violence,stabbed,"Joice was stabbed to death in a room of the Palace motel located alongside the PA-136 road connecting Castanhal to Curuçá.

The police investigated the crime as a possible hate crime as this is the second stabbing of a trans person under similar circumstances within a month (see https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2013/12/29/name-unknown_castanhal-brazil_5766caf4 for the previous case).

> The Civil Police, through the Homicide Office, investigate a crime in Castanhal, northeast of Pará, where a trans woman was stabbed to death inside a motel. Police have not dismissed the possibility of homophobic crime, as it is the second trans woman stabbed to death in less than a month.
> 
> The crime happened in room 13 of the Palace motel, located on the banks of the PA-136, road connecting Castanhal to Curuçá. According to the Civil Police, the murderer took a taxi from near the police station in downtown Castanhal and asked the taxi driver to go to BR-316, near Cosanpa, to pick up a trans sex worker. The driver followed the instructions of the passenger, and when he arrived at the place indicated, was asked: ""Which of these do you want me to take?"", referring to the trans sex workers waiting for custom.
> 
> As he had no response from the taxi driver, the killer chose, according to police, randomly the nearest trans woman. ""It's one more line of investigation we're having because, according to information from the taxi driver, the killer still asked who he should take. But the taxi driver was impartial and so the killer took the first one who approached the car"", said the delegate Temmer Khayat.
> 
>  ""According to the taxi driver, the victim charged R $50.00 for her services, which was accepted by the murderer. When he arrived at the motel, the victim entered the room while the suspect paid for the taxi"", Khayat said.
> 
> After entering the room, the victim, identified as Joice, was violently attacked from behind. The killer stabbed her several times without giving her any defend herself, and she died at the scene. ""By the time they got to the motel, and by the time he ran away, as the images on the CCTV show, it appears that they did not have sex. He was only there to kill the victim, "".
> 
This was the second murder of a trans woman in Castanhal in less than a month. On December 29, another tran woman, who worked in the same place as Joice was also stabbed to death. The Civil Police has not ruled out a connection between the two crimes, but believes that it also has other lines of investigation.
> 
> ""We do not rule out a homophobic crime, since the deaths are very close and they were similar, except that the former was still stabbed to death and the second to the motel. We are investigating the circumstances of the crime and we are going to analyze the images of the CCTV of the motel. We will also listen once more to the taxi driver to give details of the killer, as well as the owner of the property. The investigations continue and we do not rule out any hypothesis for the crime, such as revenge and reckoning, since the victim committed robberies there"", concluded Deputy Temmer Khayat.

Luo,21.0,2022-03-09,Hubei,China,30.611823,114.2561293,violence,stabbed,"Luo was stabbed to death in a restroom in the mall where she worked. The authorities attempted to suppress news of her murder.

> On March 9, the murder of a transgender person took place in Wuhan Paradise Walk, a large shopping center in downtown Wuhan. The victim was a transgender woman, who was killed in the afternoon with a knife by a man while she was using the men’s restroom in accordance with her biological sex.
> 
> The picture of the crime circulating on the Internet shows that the deceased was wearing women’s clothes and knee-high boots. Her clothes had been stripped off when she fell to the ground, so many netizens thought the deceased was a woman when the news first came out.
> 
> But soon the police preliminary notification which spread on Weibo revealed that the murder was committed with a knife at 3 p.m. on March 9 in the men’s restroom on the 4th floor of Paradise Walk. The 19-year-old male suspect Zhang and the 21-year-old victim Luo did not know each other before. They started a verbal dispute, resulting in a bloody violent clash. The victim died on the spot.
> 
> The police notification was issued at 5:30 p.m., and stated that Luo was [a trans woman] and an employee of a restaurant in the Paradise Walk. So many netizens understood that the deceased was a transgender woman who was using the men’s restroom based on her biological sex, and speculated that it was probably a hate crime born out of transphobia. 
> 
> After the incident, Weibo users condemned the killer and debated the issue of transgender rights in China. Some netizens posted posters calling attention to hate crimes against transgender people in China.
> 
> However, the discussion was immediately suppressed by the authorities’ Internet control department. Topics such as “Wuhan Paradise Walk murder case,” “Wuhan Paradise Walk murder,” and even simply “Wuhan Paradise Walk” were blocked. Netizens were confronted with a message that, “According to relevant laws, regulations and policies, the topic page is not displayed.” 
> 
> A transgender blogger named who had tried to generate attention for the case on Weibo, also deleted her earlier Weibo post exposing the incident, claiming that she had received a phone call from Wuhan police. “Because the suspect’s behavior was too bad and the scene was very bloody, and the suspect has been caught on the spot and is being interrogated about the motive of the crime, so to avoid the impact on the victim’s family, as well as not to affect the police investigation work, I deleted that previous microblogging, please wait patiently for the police notice,” [she] said in the comment section of Weibo.
> 
> She also posted, “Please wait patiently for the police notice, the final case results will also be posted simultaneously on the magistrate’s office site.” But at the time of this writing, Wuhan police still had not made any public statements on the matter, and the official Weibo page of Wuhan Paradise Walk had not been updated since 5:32 p.m. on March 9th. 
> 
> Bitter Winter has also received reports from several Wuhan residents being warned by police over the phone to delete their posts with videos and pictures related to this murder. Police threatened them with legal consequences if they did not remove the posts about the homicide.

She had been asking for medical help for nearly 2 months, but ICE only took her to hospital after she lost consciousness.

<sup><sub>* ICE is Immigration Customs Enforcement, a US federal agency [known to mistreat detained asylum seekers](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/22-immigrants-died-ice-detention-centers-during-past-2-years-n954781).</sub></small>

Grecia, a trans activist from Casa Migrante in Juarez, Mexico who accompanied Joa until the end said the following:

> ""Her name was Johana Medina, known to her friends as Joa. She was in ICE detention for two months in a New Mexico facility. For weeks she pleaded for medical help, referring to health problems caused by complications with HIV/AIDS.
> 
> After two months of suffering, Joana became extremely ill and unconscious forcing ICE to take her to Las Palmas del Sol Hospital in El Paso, Texas. This morning I went to visit her at the hospital intensive care unit. When I looked at her I said that what happened a year ago to [Roxana](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2018/05/13/roxana-hernandez-rodriguez_milan-new-mexico-usa_76611862) in the month of May could happen to Joa right in there.
> 
> And it did. Unfortunately today at 21:00 hrs I got called by the hospital to tell me that she had passed away... ¨

[Diversidad Sin Fronteras](https://www.facebook.com/pg/diversidadsinfronteraz) issued the following statement:
> 
> “We regret to inform the community that ICE has taken one more of our sisters. Johana Medina aka Joa, a Salvadoran trans woman has died in ICE custody in a hospital of El Paso, Tx yesterday at 21:00.”
> 
> “We’re seen as people that aren’t part of society. Like we’re a disease. Inhuman.”
said the five trans asylum seekers interviewed by the San Antonio Express-News who are in or recently released from the Pearsall detention center.
> 
> Joa is the 23rd person overall and the second trans person to die while in ICE custody according to an NBC report dated Jan 6th 2019. Most like Roxana Hernández have died due to the Trump administration’s uncaring erratic detention policies. Adding insult to injury many and have suffered continuing inhumanities as the Government lies about and tries to hide their deaths.
> 
> We will update when more information becomes available.
> 
> Rest in Power Joa.

Later the same day a friend issued the following update:

> This the latest info I have gathered from family and friends regarding Joa's passing in ICE detention. Dates are approximate and they are gathered from phone convos:
> 
> Before April 11th: She had been waiting for her number #7326 to come up for her to present legally to seek asylum. She waited nearly three months in Juarez.
> 
> April 11th: She presented to CBP in El Paso, Tx. According to testimonies from her boyfriend and other trans women present: ""she was told she was not trans"", that ""she was a man."" Unlike her other comrades, she was not paroled out but sent to Otero County Processing Center.
> 
> May 21st: She calls her boyfriend to El Salvador telling him that she is not feeling well. She tells him she misses him and that was the last time he spoke to her.
> 
> From April 11th to May 23rd or 24th: Her health deteriorated. In El Salvador she was a certified nurse so she knew she was unable to take medication orally and in repetitive occasions she told ICE officers she needed an (IV) solution, that she could do it herself but she just needed the medication.
> 
> May 23th-25th: ICE decides to take her to the hospital after she appears to be unconscious. According to family members, she was granted release on recognizance the day she was dropped off at the hospital.
> 
> June 1st: Her uncle and Grecia, a trans leader from Juarez are notified Joa has passed away in Las Palmas del Sol hospital at 9:05pm.
> 
> She was loved by all of her family including her grandma the main reason for her to travel thousands of miles to be detained in inhumane conditions. She was unable to practice her nursing profession as an open trans woman so her dream was to come to the US to get certified and make a living healing people.
> 
> We send condolences to her partner, family, and friends.

Subsequently it emerged that ICE had deliberately withheld even basic medical care.

> Medina León, who worked as a nurse in El Salvador, recognized that she needed IV fluids, but was denied. When she asked for water, sugar and salt so she could make her own IV, Ice also refused, the claim said. The treatment in Ice custody was so bad that Medina León, who was fleeing violence in her home country, requested to be deported so she could get medical attention, lawyers said. That request was also denied.
>
> “She came to the US because she thought it was a great country and that she would be safe there,” her 22-year-old sister, Gabriela León, said in an email to the Guardian, sent by her lawyer. “She did everything right but was treated as a criminal … She shouldn’t have died. She went to the US seeking protection and now she is coming home to us dead.”
> 
> Christopher Dolan, an attorney who filed the claim, added: “She was desperate, because the government would not provide her with assistance of any kind for her medical needs.”

> A debt of R $ 5,000 led a drug user to kill a [trans woman] in Piraquara, in the metropolitan region of Curitiba (RMC).

Both were arrested and investigations into the case were concluded on Wednesday (10).

So, I was on duty at the Central de Flagrantes in the metropolitan region and I knew that there was this police report (BO) talking about her disappearance”, said delegate Nasser Salmen to Banda B.
